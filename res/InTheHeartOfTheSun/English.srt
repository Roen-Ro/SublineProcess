1
00:00:13,613 --> 00:00:15,615
Peiking has changed so fast.

2
00:00:20,620 --> 00:00:23,612
In 20 years, it's become a modern city.

3
00:00:24,624 --> 00:00:27,616
Almost nothing is as I remembered.

4
00:00:28,628 --> 00:00:31,596
Change has wiped out my memorize.

5
00:00:31,631 --> 00:00:34,623
I can't tell what's
imagined from what's real.

6
00:00:36,636 --> 00:00:39,604
My stories always take place in summer.

7
00:00:39,639 --> 00:00:42,636
People expose more of
themselves in the heat.

8
00:00:42,671 --> 00:00:45,634
and find it harder to
control their desires.

9
00:00:46,646 --> 00:00:49,614
It seemed like it was
always summer then.

10
00:00:49,649 --> 00:00:52,652
The sun always had time to
come out and play with us.

11
00:00:52,687 --> 00:00:54,654
The sunlight was so relentless,

12
00:00:54,689 --> 00:00:56,621
so bright,

13
00:00:56,656 --> 00:00:59,659
that our eyes were washed
in waves of blackness.

14
00:00:59,694 --> 00:01:02,651
In the Heat of the Sun.

15
00:01:17,677 --> 00:01:20,669
In the raging storms of Revolution.

16
00:01:21,681 --> 00:01:24,673
The soldiers' hearts
turn towards the sun.

17
00:01:25,685 --> 00:01:28,653
Oh, Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao.

18
00:01:28,688 --> 00:01:31,680
We want to express our ardor to you.

19
00:01:35,695 --> 00:01:38,687
You launched the Cultural Revolution.

20
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:43,668
and your military
victories are stunning.

21
00:01:43,703 --> 00:01:46,695
Your brilliant thoughts
are like dew and sunlight.

22
00:01:53,713 --> 00:01:54,679
After the 9th Party Congress in 1969.

23
00:01:54,714 --> 00:01:57,717
my father was sent to
Guizhou as an army rep.

24
00:01:57,752 --> 00:02:00,720
to stop factional battles
taking place there.

25
00:02:14,734 --> 00:02:17,737
I longed for a Sino-Soviet war.

26
00:02:17,772 --> 00:02:18,703
I was sure

27
00:02:18,738 --> 00:02:20,705
that in a new world war...

28
00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:23,732
...the PLA's iron fist would
smash the Soviets and Americans.

29
00:02:26,746 --> 00:02:29,738
A new war hero would become a legend -

30
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:33,742
that's me, of course.

31
00:04:09,849 --> 00:04:12,841
Hurry

32
00:04:15,855 --> 00:04:18,847
wild goose hurry on your way.

33
00:04:26,866 --> 00:04:29,858
With a letter from the
liberated serfs under your wing.

34
00:04:34,874 --> 00:04:37,866
passing on love to
Chairman Mao in Peking.

35
00:04:46,886 --> 00:04:47,852
After Dad left

36
00:04:47,887 --> 00:04:50,855
I was freer than I'd ever been.

37
00:04:50,890 --> 00:04:53,882
I always envied kids whose
parents worked out of town.

38
00:04:54,894 --> 00:04:57,886
Now I was one of them.

39
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:21,886
Let's bet that

40
00:05:21,921 --> 00:05:22,922
who can toss their bag the highest.

41
00:05:22,957 --> 00:05:24,924
What's the wager?

42
00:05:24,959 --> 00:05:25,890
Icepops?

43
00:05:25,925 --> 00:05:26,926
Butter flavor.

44
00:05:26,961 --> 00:05:27,944
Two.

45
00:05:27,979 --> 00:05:28,893
Ok.

46
00:05:28,928 --> 00:05:29,929
let me go first!

47
00:05:29,964 --> 00:05:31,896
No.

48
00:05:31,931 --> 00:05:32,897
We'll start with Big Ant.

49
00:05:32,932 --> 00:05:35,924
See if you can get is
as high as the roof.

50
00:05:36,936 --> 00:05:37,902
Ok,

51
00:05:37,937 --> 00:05:39,939
go for it Big Ant.

52
00:05:39,974 --> 00:05:41,958
1, 2, 3

53
00:05:41,993 --> 00:05:43,908
No good.

54
00:05:43,943 --> 00:05:46,946
Your turn Liu Sitian.

55
00:05:46,981 --> 00:05:49,938
1, 2, 3

56
00:05:51,951 --> 00:05:53,953
No good, no good!

57
00:05:53,988 --> 00:05:55,955
Yang Gao, your turn.

58
00:05:55,990 --> 00:05:58,947
1, 2, 3

59
00:05:59,959 --> 00:06:01,961
Oh, look at that stupid thing!

60
00:06:01,996 --> 00:06:04,964
Your turn, Monkey.

61
00:06:04,999 --> 00:06:07,956
1, 2, 3

62
00:06:21,981 --> 00:06:22,947
You are such a lazy bastard...

63
00:06:22,982 --> 00:06:24,984
You even hold on to your bag yourself?

64
00:06:25,019 --> 00:06:25,950
Come on!

65
00:06:25,985 --> 00:06:28,953
Big Ant! Big Ant!

66
00:06:28,988 --> 00:06:30,955
And so I graduated from primary school.

67
00:06:30,990 --> 00:06:32,992
We were all sent to
different high schools.

68
00:06:33,027 --> 00:06:36,012
This was a policy of the school...

69
00:06:36,047 --> 00:06:38,998
aimed at breaking up our little gangs.

70
00:06:39,033 --> 00:06:39,964
But several years later...

71
00:06:39,999 --> 00:06:42,991
Our families all moved to
the same army compound...

72
00:06:44,003 --> 00:06:46,005
and I was reunited with my mates.

73
00:06:47,006 --> 00:06:48,007
Gooloomoo!

74
00:06:48,042 --> 00:06:49,025
Gooloomoo!

75
00:06:49,060 --> 00:06:50,535
Oo-ba!

76
00:06:50,570 --> 00:06:52,786
Gooloomoo!

77
00:06:52,821 --> 00:06:55,003
Oo-ba!

78
00:07:13,032 --> 00:07:13,998
In the seventies.

79
00:07:14,033 --> 00:07:17,025
Beijing didn't have so
many cars or luxury hotels.

80
00:07:18,037 --> 00:07:20,004
or even that many people on the street.

81
00:07:20,039 --> 00:07:23,031
The older kids were in
the villages or army.

82
00:07:24,043 --> 00:07:27,046
and the town belonged to us.

83
00:07:27,081 --> 00:07:30,049
Time for class. Attention!

84
00:07:30,084 --> 00:07:32,563
Hello students!

85
00:07:32,598 --> 00:07:35,043
Hello teacher!

86
00:07:37,056 --> 00:07:40,024
Don't laugh.

87
00:07:40,059 --> 00:07:42,061
It's a simple principle of physics.

88
00:07:42,096 --> 00:07:45,053
Sit down.

89
00:07:49,068 --> 00:07:51,070
Who said you could get up?

90
00:07:51,105 --> 00:07:54,038
Take your seat!

91
00:07:54,073 --> 00:07:57,065
I mean, first put that hat
back and take your seat.

92
00:07:58,077 --> 00:08:01,045
Yes, Mr. Hu.

93
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:04,072
Who's class monitor?

94
00:08:05,084 --> 00:08:06,050
She is.

95
00:08:06,085 --> 00:08:09,088
Get back here.

96
00:08:09,123 --> 00:08:12,056
Who's asking you?

97
00:08:12,091 --> 00:08:14,093
I am asking class monitor
to identify herself.

98
00:08:17,096 --> 00:08:20,088
After class, get rid of these coals.

99
00:08:23,102 --> 00:08:26,094
Open your books to page 35.

100
00:08:52,131 --> 00:08:55,123
Let's look at the Sino-Russion
Treaty of Nerchinsk.

101
00:08:58,137 --> 00:08:59,103
"Sino"

102
00:08:59,138 --> 00:09:02,141
refers to the Qing dynasty.

103
00:09:02,176 --> 00:09:03,107
"Russian"

104
00:09:03,142 --> 00:09:06,134
to czarist Russia.

105
00:09:12,151 --> 00:09:15,148
But Nerchinsk,

106
00:09:15,183 --> 00:09:18,146
what's Nerchinsk?

107
00:09:22,161 --> 00:09:25,153
It's the region east
of the Baykal Lake.

108
00:09:31,170 --> 00:09:34,162
Who did this?

109
00:09:36,175 --> 00:09:38,177
What's the meaning of this, huh?

110
00:09:38,212 --> 00:09:39,143
Who?

111
00:09:39,178 --> 00:09:42,175
It wasn't me. My hands are clean.

112
00:09:42,210 --> 00:09:45,173
Hold up your hands, everyone.

113
00:09:51,190 --> 00:09:52,191
Mr. Hu.

114
00:09:52,226 --> 00:09:54,205
Speak up.

115
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:56,184
Never mind.

116
00:09:58,197 --> 00:10:00,164
Speak up,

117
00:10:00,199 --> 00:10:02,166
don't be afraid.

118
00:10:02,201 --> 00:10:05,204
Maybe it was to keep the
hat from flying off again.

119
00:10:05,239 --> 00:10:08,207
It was well-intentioned.
So don't be angry.

120
00:10:08,242 --> 00:10:10,721
I'm asking who did it!

121
00:10:10,756 --> 00:10:13,201
Well I don't know.

122
00:10:16,215 --> 00:10:17,181
Sit down.

123
00:10:17,216 --> 00:10:20,208
Don't be angry. Mr. Hu.

124
00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:24,188
Class is adjourned.

125
00:10:24,223 --> 00:10:27,215
I shall get to that bottom of this!

126
00:10:46,245 --> 00:10:49,213
Mr. Hu, Mr. Hu!

127
00:10:49,248 --> 00:10:52,216
Would you mind tossing me my shoe?

128
00:10:52,251 --> 00:10:55,243
Sure, and I'll wipe your
ass in the toilet too!

129
00:10:57,256 --> 00:10:59,258
Shall I help you put it on as well?

130
00:10:59,293 --> 00:11:00,224
NO,

131
00:11:00,259 --> 00:11:01,260
Just toss it out here, please.

132
00:11:01,295 --> 00:11:02,779
Get out of here!

133
00:11:02,814 --> 00:11:04,263
You rotten apple!

134
00:11:06,265 --> 00:11:08,767
Mr. Jiao!

135
00:11:08,802 --> 00:11:11,235
Someone

136
00:11:11,270 --> 00:11:14,273
get Mr. Jiao of the Workers
Propaganda Team here right now!

137
00:11:14,308 --> 00:11:15,239
Jeez, Hu.

138
00:11:15,274 --> 00:11:16,775
give me a bit of face, OK?

139
00:11:16,810 --> 00:11:18,277
I'm not asking for much.

140
00:11:18,312 --> 00:11:19,796
OK, just you wait!

141
00:11:19,831 --> 00:11:22,057
Wait for what?

142
00:11:22,092 --> 00:11:24,248
What a joke?

143
00:11:24,283 --> 00:11:25,284
What are you going to do?

144
00:11:25,319 --> 00:11:27,251
don't threaten me.

145
00:11:27,286 --> 00:11:30,289
Fine. I don't need that stupid show.

146
00:11:30,324 --> 00:11:31,255
come back here!

147
00:11:31,290 --> 00:11:33,257
Going to have someone beat me?

148
00:11:33,292 --> 00:11:36,284
Puncture my bicycle
tires? Stab me in the back?

149
00:11:38,297 --> 00:11:41,289
No one wants your filthy shoe.

150
00:13:09,388 --> 00:13:12,380
Attention! March in time!

151
00:13:19,398 --> 00:13:22,401
Our leaders should rest assured,
we will complete our mission.

152
00:13:22,436 --> 00:13:24,915
8-5-1, 8-5-1, this is
Yan'an, this is Yan'an.

153
00:13:24,950 --> 00:13:27,395
Fire in my direction!
Fire in my direction!

154
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:02,466
I loved keys.

155
00:15:02,501 --> 00:15:04,468
I learned how to make them.

156
00:15:04,503 --> 00:15:06,505
I practiced on all the locks at home.

157
00:15:06,540 --> 00:15:08,472
peering into my parents' secrets.

158
00:15:08,507 --> 00:15:11,499
Then I began going into
other people's homes.

159
00:15:13,512 --> 00:15:15,479
The "click" of a lock popping open.

160
00:15:15,514 --> 00:15:18,517
propelled me into a
realm of sheer bliss.

161
00:15:18,552 --> 00:15:20,484
This feeling

162
00:15:20,519 --> 00:15:23,511
This feeling, only the Soviet army attacking
Berlin in WWII could have felt what I feel.

163
00:15:27,526 --> 00:15:28,492
I can't hid it.

164
00:15:28,527 --> 00:15:31,530
I got my talent from my father.

165
00:15:31,565 --> 00:15:32,496
In the Korean War.

166
00:15:32,531 --> 00:15:35,523
he worked out how to
countless American bombs.

167
00:15:38,537 --> 00:15:40,539
Lots of people lost
their lives that way.

168
00:15:40,574 --> 00:15:42,506
but he came out of it
without a scratch...

169
00:15:42,541 --> 00:15:45,544
which is why Mom suspects
that all his time in Korea

170
00:15:45,579 --> 00:15:48,536
was spent hiding out in the mountains.

171
00:15:49,548 --> 00:15:51,550
I'd check carefully for any cash.

172
00:15:54,553 --> 00:15:57,545
The machines everyone demands
today were unknown then.

173
00:15:59,558 --> 00:16:02,561
Work units provided
most of the furniture.

174
00:16:02,596 --> 00:16:03,527
I can testify that at the time...

175
00:16:03,562 --> 00:16:06,565
expect for a very few
politically suspect cadres.

176
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:09,568
there was virtually
no corruption at all.

177
00:16:09,603 --> 00:16:10,534
In all my exploits...

178
00:16:10,569 --> 00:16:13,561
I only spotted one old
Soviet black-n-white TV.

179
00:16:14,573 --> 00:16:17,075
I considered stealing it,

180
00:16:17,110 --> 00:16:19,578
but it was too heavy.

181
00:16:19,613 --> 00:16:20,544
Besides,

182
00:16:20,579 --> 00:16:22,080
I vowed I'd only break in,

183
00:16:22,115 --> 00:16:23,349
I wouldn't be a thief.

184
00:16:23,384 --> 00:16:24,984
When I tired myself out...

185
00:16:25,019 --> 00:16:26,550
I'd take a nap on the bed.

186
00:16:26,585 --> 00:16:29,577
imagining what might
have happened there.

187
00:16:31,590 --> 00:16:34,582
I knew I'd never be caught.

188
00:16:35,594 --> 00:16:38,597
'cause no one ever snuck
out of their office then.

189
00:16:38,632 --> 00:16:40,564
And I never stole anything,

190
00:16:40,599 --> 00:16:43,591
so I didn't arouse any suspicion.

191
00:16:52,611 --> 00:16:55,603
Of course, I ran into
trouble from time to time.

192
00:17:45,664 --> 00:17:48,656
But this didn't dampen my courage.

193
00:17:49,668 --> 00:17:52,660
it only increased the thrill.

194
00:18:18,697 --> 00:18:21,689
Usually, I only went for
padlocks, they were safe.

195
00:18:22,701 --> 00:18:25,693
But that day, something moved
me to pick a built-in one.

196
00:20:15,814 --> 00:20:18,806
I'll be damned.

197
00:20:37,836 --> 00:20:40,828
I'll be damned.

198
00:20:46,845 --> 00:20:49,837
I'll be damned.

199
00:20:54,853 --> 00:20:57,845
Well, Hu, you've fallen low!

200
00:22:37,956 --> 00:22:39,923
This is Yu Beipei,

201
00:22:39,958 --> 00:22:40,959
from the Foreign Ministry compound.

202
00:22:40,994 --> 00:22:42,961
This is our mate, Ma Xiaojun.

203
00:22:42,996 --> 00:22:44,928
Come on up!

204
00:22:44,963 --> 00:22:45,929
That's Liu Yiku.

205
00:22:45,964 --> 00:22:47,966
Liu Sitian's stepbrother...

206
00:22:48,001 --> 00:22:49,968
just out of the army.

207
00:22:50,003 --> 00:22:51,987
He was handsome.

208
00:22:52,022 --> 00:22:53,937
and fought dirty.

209
00:22:53,972 --> 00:22:55,939
We thought he was terrific,

210
00:22:55,974 --> 00:22:57,976
'cause he always brought home girls.

211
00:23:01,980 --> 00:23:03,947
She was called Yu Beipei.

212
00:23:03,982 --> 00:23:05,984
That "pei" is usually pronounced "bei".

213
00:23:06,019 --> 00:23:07,951
But we called her Yu Beipei...

214
00:23:07,986 --> 00:23:10,978
and even she didn't
know which was correct.

215
00:23:13,992 --> 00:23:15,994
I didn't know you were waiting?

216
00:23:16,029 --> 00:23:17,012
No one told me anything.

217
00:23:17,047 --> 00:23:19,017
Had a date, did you?

218
00:23:19,052 --> 00:23:20,988
Fuck you! No way!

219
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,992
Don't be embarrassed, Monkey!

220
00:23:26,004 --> 00:23:28,996
Say it! Who had the date.

221
00:23:36,014 --> 00:23:39,006
Enough, enough.

222
00:23:40,018 --> 00:23:41,985
what thin skin!

223
00:23:42,020 --> 00:23:43,987
What's so bad about having a date?

224
00:23:44,022 --> 00:23:46,024
Wasn't it a date that
brought me here today?

225
00:23:46,059 --> 00:23:49,027
Who with?

226
00:23:49,062 --> 00:23:52,019
Him.

227
00:23:53,031 --> 00:23:56,023
Come, sit over here.

228
00:23:59,037 --> 00:24:00,003
Just ignore them,

229
00:24:00,038 --> 00:24:02,005
they've got dirty minds.

230
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:04,542
She's talking about you, Ant.

231
00:24:04,577 --> 00:24:06,812
Ignorant fool! Filthy mind!

232
00:24:06,847 --> 00:24:09,047
I'm wasting my breath on you!

233
00:24:09,082 --> 00:24:12,015
Now he's talking!

234
00:24:12,050 --> 00:24:15,053
Forget it, have a cigarette.

235
00:24:15,088 --> 00:24:18,021
Yu Beipei...

236
00:24:18,056 --> 00:24:21,059
next time bring Mi Lan with you.

237
00:24:21,094 --> 00:24:23,026
We want to meet her.

238
00:24:23,061 --> 00:24:25,063
You want to chat here up?

239
00:24:25,098 --> 00:24:27,030
Find her yourself.

240
00:24:27,065 --> 00:24:30,057
Haven't you said no girl
can resist your charms?

241
00:24:31,069 --> 00:24:32,035
Seriously.

242
00:24:32,070 --> 00:24:34,072
we hear so much about her.

243
00:24:34,107 --> 00:24:35,038
She's a legend.

244
00:24:35,073 --> 00:24:36,039
Guys have fought over her...

245
00:24:36,074 --> 00:24:39,077
friendships have ended
and some have died.

246
00:24:39,112 --> 00:24:42,080
All we ask is that you introduce us.

247
00:24:42,115 --> 00:24:45,072
Forget it, she's a proper sort.

248
00:24:46,084 --> 00:24:47,585
I didn't say she wasn't.

249
00:24:47,620 --> 00:24:49,087
Anyway, I've asked her.

250
00:24:49,122 --> 00:24:52,079
and she said no.

251
00:24:54,092 --> 00:24:57,095
The photo I discovered
that day put me in a daze.

252
00:24:57,130 --> 00:25:00,098
She filled my entire field of vision.

253
00:25:00,133 --> 00:25:02,065
The implications of her gaze...

254
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:05,068
were bounded only by my imagination.

255
00:25:05,103 --> 00:25:08,106
I had no idea she was the
Mi Lan everyone talked about.

256
00:25:18,116 --> 00:25:20,112
Gooloomoo!

257
00:25:20,147 --> 00:25:22,109
Oo-ba!

258
00:25:43,141 --> 00:25:46,133
Kiss, and one more.

259
00:25:53,151 --> 00:25:56,143
Catch him!

260
00:26:13,171 --> 00:26:16,163
You OK, Yu Beipei?

261
00:26:22,180 --> 00:26:25,172
I'll bite you to death.

262
00:26:33,191 --> 00:26:35,193
Let go, let go!

263
00:26:35,228 --> 00:26:37,707
Let me go!

264
00:26:37,742 --> 00:26:40,187
Let me go!

265
00:26:43,201 --> 00:26:46,193
I'll get you, you little bastard!

266
00:26:47,205 --> 00:26:50,197
Forget it, leave him alone, Yu Beipei.

267
00:27:06,224 --> 00:27:09,221
Beautiful flowers
blossom across the land.

268
00:27:09,256 --> 00:27:12,219
Friends are coming from distant places.

269
00:27:17,235 --> 00:27:20,238
Flowers of friendship
blossom across the land.

270
00:27:20,273 --> 00:27:23,230
Welcome! Welcome! Warmly welcome!

271
00:27:24,242 --> 00:27:27,239
Welcome! Welcome! Warmly welcome!

272
00:27:27,274 --> 00:27:30,237
Welcome! Welcome! Warmly welcome!

273
00:30:13,411 --> 00:30:15,913
I was always hanging out there...

274
00:30:15,948 --> 00:30:18,381
like a cat on a hot tin roof.

275
00:30:18,416 --> 00:30:21,408
frantic for the girl in
the picture to appear.

276
00:30:22,420 --> 00:30:23,386
Like a ghost...

277
00:30:23,421 --> 00:30:26,389
she came and went without a trace.

278
00:30:26,424 --> 00:30:29,416
Only my intuition and
a lingering fragrance...

279
00:30:30,428 --> 00:30:33,396
could verify her existence.

280
00:30:33,431 --> 00:30:35,433
I'd wait till the stars
were high in the sky,

281
00:30:38,436 --> 00:30:41,428
and still nothing.

282
00:33:49,627 --> 00:33:51,128
the ambassador.

283
00:33:51,163 --> 00:33:52,595
It's Koreans.

284
00:33:52,630 --> 00:33:53,631
How would you know?

285
00:33:53,666 --> 00:33:55,598
It's true.

286
00:33:55,633 --> 00:33:58,625
But didn't the ambassador
come last night?

287
00:34:01,639 --> 00:34:04,631
What would you know?
There's no just on, you know.

288
00:34:05,643 --> 00:34:07,645
There's gotta be two or there at least.

289
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:09,647
Maybe this one's from South Korea?

290
00:34:09,682 --> 00:34:11,666
What the fuck would you know?

291
00:34:11,701 --> 00:34:13,677
South Korea is America's.

292
00:34:13,712 --> 00:34:15,653
We wouldn't even let him in.

293
00:34:15,688 --> 00:34:17,620
Running dog!

294
00:34:17,655 --> 00:34:20,647
Who's a running dog?

295
00:34:22,660 --> 00:34:25,652
Hey, which country
is she ambassador for?

296
00:34:39,677 --> 00:34:42,669
Yu Beipei, go get her
to come talk to us.

297
00:35:27,725 --> 00:35:30,717
Have some soda.

298
00:35:32,730 --> 00:35:35,733
What'd you say to her?

299
00:35:35,768 --> 00:35:36,734
Are you a dancer?

300
00:35:36,769 --> 00:35:37,700
yes.

301
00:35:37,735 --> 00:35:39,702
At Youth Palace?

302
00:35:39,737 --> 00:35:42,740
Can you tell me your name?

303
00:35:42,775 --> 00:35:44,707
I'm Ma Xiaojun.

304
00:35:44,742 --> 00:35:47,239
I'm Zhang Xiaomei. "Xiao" as in "dawn".

305
00:35:47,274 --> 00:35:49,736
The "Xiao" in my name means "small".

306
00:35:50,748 --> 00:35:52,249
These guys really are a pain.

307
00:35:52,284 --> 00:35:53,518
Where do you think you're going?

308
00:35:53,553 --> 00:35:54,752
Where do you think you're going?

309
00:35:54,787 --> 00:35:55,718
I love music,

310
00:35:55,753 --> 00:35:56,754
just wanted to see the concert.

311
00:35:57,755 --> 00:36:00,747
Just because you're a music lover
you pretend to be a foreigner.

312
00:36:01,759 --> 00:36:02,760
And the Korean ambassador at that.

313
00:36:04,762 --> 00:36:06,764
What's the real story?

314
00:36:07,765 --> 00:36:08,766
What are you doing?

315
00:36:08,801 --> 00:36:09,732
What's wrong?

316
00:36:09,767 --> 00:36:10,768
What d'ya mean, what's wrong?

317
00:36:10,803 --> 00:36:11,786
What the hell...

318
00:36:11,821 --> 00:36:12,796
"what the hell"?!

319
00:36:12,831 --> 00:36:13,771
I didn't do anything.

320
00:36:13,806 --> 00:36:14,737
Right.

321
00:36:14,772 --> 00:36:16,774
I've had my eye on you. Come on!

322
00:36:16,809 --> 00:36:18,741
What'd I do? I didn't do anything.

323
00:36:18,776 --> 00:36:21,768
And the girl there,
you're coming in as well.

324
00:36:27,785 --> 00:36:28,786
Your father's name?

325
00:36:28,821 --> 00:36:29,804
Ma Wenzhong.

326
00:36:29,839 --> 00:36:30,814
Your mother?

327
00:36:30,849 --> 00:36:31,754
Zhai Ru.

328
00:36:31,789 --> 00:36:33,756
Where do you live?

329
00:36:33,791 --> 00:36:36,783
No.11 Internal Affairs
Department Street.

330
00:36:52,810 --> 00:36:55,802
What are you looking at?

331
00:36:56,814 --> 00:36:58,781
Just found this. What a menace!

332
00:36:58,816 --> 00:37:01,808
Don't let that sort of
thing slip by next time.

333
00:37:04,822 --> 00:37:07,825
That gang's not going anywhere.

334
00:37:07,860 --> 00:37:09,792
Carrying arms!

335
00:37:09,827 --> 00:37:10,793
Gonna rebel, were they?

336
00:37:10,828 --> 00:37:11,829
We'll take 'em to lockup this evening.

337
00:37:11,864 --> 00:37:13,348
Guoqing!

338
00:37:13,383 --> 00:37:14,797
Hear that?

339
00:37:14,832 --> 00:37:17,800
Uncle, Uncle, please let me go.

340
00:37:17,835 --> 00:37:20,827
What are you crying
about? What's his story?

341
00:37:21,839 --> 00:37:24,341
I was waiting for tickets,

342
00:37:24,376 --> 00:37:26,809
and they hauled me in.

343
00:37:26,844 --> 00:37:29,836
Look at you, you think
half of Peking is your turf.

344
00:37:30,848 --> 00:37:32,850
If it's anyone's turf, it's ours.

345
00:37:32,885 --> 00:37:35,842
Get that? yes.

346
00:37:36,854 --> 00:37:38,821
Wipe the snot off your nose...

347
00:37:38,856 --> 00:37:40,858
and don't show you
face round here again.

348
00:37:40,893 --> 00:37:43,826
Get that?

349
00:37:43,861 --> 00:37:45,863
This isn't mine, that is.

350
00:37:45,898 --> 00:37:48,831
that.

351
00:37:48,866 --> 00:37:49,867
You taking it or what?

352
00:37:49,902 --> 00:37:50,833
yes.

353
00:37:50,868 --> 00:37:51,869
If not, you're welcome
to spend the night here.

354
00:37:51,904 --> 00:37:54,861
I'm taking it! This one is fine!

355
00:38:45,923 --> 00:38:47,925
Go fetch my belt.

356
00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:49,892
My belt! Go get it!

357
00:38:49,927 --> 00:38:52,930
Don't you think you're Mr. Tough?

358
00:38:52,965 --> 00:38:54,449
Lose your nerve, have you?

359
00:38:54,484 --> 00:38:55,933
Get up off your knees...

360
00:38:55,968 --> 00:38:56,899
and stop crying.

361
00:38:56,934 --> 00:38:58,936
I don't buy that crap.

362
00:38:58,971 --> 00:39:00,903
When I cry,

363
00:39:00,938 --> 00:39:03,906
it's just to confuse you wimps.

364
00:39:03,941 --> 00:39:06,944
What's if your business
if I pick up chicks?

365
00:39:06,979 --> 00:39:07,945
I'm not after your mother.

366
00:39:08,946 --> 00:39:10,948
I'm coming back to do it again tomorrow.

367
00:39:10,983 --> 00:39:11,914
I'll be alone.

368
00:39:11,949 --> 00:39:14,952
If you don't arrest
me you can kiss my ass.

369
00:39:14,987 --> 00:39:16,954
I'm the king of half of Peking...

370
00:39:16,989 --> 00:39:19,957
and of your station as well.

371
00:39:19,992 --> 00:39:22,925
OK, Get outta here.

372
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:25,952
If you don't move it, you're
welcome to spend the night.

373
00:39:41,979 --> 00:39:44,971
Who's there?

374
00:39:55,993 --> 00:39:57,995
Someone's bashed Yang Gao.

375
00:39:58,030 --> 00:39:59,962
Fuck!

376
00:39:59,997 --> 00:40:01,964
On his way home...

377
00:40:01,999 --> 00:40:04,001
he saw some kids from Liutiao
bullying the retarded boy.

378
00:40:04,036 --> 00:40:06,521
They were making him eat catshit...

379
00:40:06,556 --> 00:40:08,281
and trying to take away his pole.

380
00:40:08,316 --> 00:40:10,007
Yang Gao went to his rescue...

381
00:40:10,042 --> 00:40:11,974
and they bashed him up.

382
00:40:12,009 --> 00:40:15,001
He can't open his eyes.
They broke the pole in half.

383
00:40:19,016 --> 00:40:22,008
Let's go.

384
00:40:26,023 --> 00:40:28,019
What about me?

385
00:40:28,054 --> 00:40:30,016
Girls stay behind.

386
00:41:47,104 --> 00:41:50,096
I wasn't involved, mate!

387
00:41:52,109 --> 00:41:55,101
Out of my way!

388
00:41:59,116 --> 00:42:02,108
Yang Gao, was he involved?

389
00:42:37,154 --> 00:42:40,146
Let's go.

390
00:43:08,185 --> 00:43:10,152
Monkey...

391
00:43:10,187 --> 00:43:12,189
when'd you get to be such a thug.

392
00:43:12,224 --> 00:43:14,156
What do you mean?

393
00:43:14,191 --> 00:43:17,194
What you did with that brick?

394
00:43:17,229 --> 00:43:20,162
It was dark. I couldn't see.

395
00:43:20,197 --> 00:43:22,199
Otherwise I'd really have wasted him.

396
00:43:24,201 --> 00:43:27,193
If you told Monkey he was fat he'd loosen
his belt. He's really full of himself now!

397
00:43:49,226 --> 00:43:51,228
Actually...

398
00:43:51,263 --> 00:43:53,195
Actually what?

399
00:43:53,230 --> 00:43:56,233
I don't think that kid was involved.

400
00:43:56,268 --> 00:43:57,199
Fuck you!

401
00:43:57,234 --> 00:44:00,237
Asshole! Why didn't you say so earlier?

402
00:44:00,272 --> 00:44:02,204
It all happened...

403
00:44:02,239 --> 00:44:04,241
before I got a good look.

404
00:44:04,276 --> 00:44:06,243
He's part of that gang.

405
00:44:06,278 --> 00:44:07,209
What the hell!

406
00:44:07,244 --> 00:44:10,236
Get out of my sight.

407
00:44:12,249 --> 00:44:15,241
Who's there?

408
00:44:17,254 --> 00:44:20,246
Yu Beipei.

409
00:44:27,264 --> 00:44:28,230
Monkey.

410
00:44:28,265 --> 00:44:31,233
You asshole.

411
00:44:31,268 --> 00:44:34,260
I'm going to get you.

412
00:44:35,272 --> 00:44:37,239
Come on out, then.

413
00:44:37,274 --> 00:44:40,266
come on, get a move on.

414
00:44:43,280 --> 00:44:46,272
You jerks.

415
00:44:47,284 --> 00:44:50,276
Look at this. My clothes are soaking.

416
00:44:51,288 --> 00:44:53,290
And you've torn the sleeve.

417
00:44:53,325 --> 00:44:55,257
Jeez, you're a pain.

418
00:44:55,292 --> 00:44:57,294
Yu Beipei, you've got to leave. Go away!

419
00:44:57,329 --> 00:44:58,260
No

420
00:44:58,295 --> 00:45:00,262
I won't.

421
00:45:00,297 --> 00:45:03,289
I said, get out!

422
00:45:04,301 --> 00:45:06,268
You bore me!

423
00:45:06,303 --> 00:45:09,295
Hiding like that...

424
00:45:10,307 --> 00:45:13,299
as if anyone wanted to look at you guys.

425
00:45:18,315 --> 00:45:20,817
Oh no! Those are my clothes!

426
00:45:20,852 --> 00:45:23,320
I don't care whose they are.

427
00:45:23,355 --> 00:45:25,287
Monkey.

428
00:45:25,322 --> 00:45:28,314
this all your fault.

429
00:45:30,327 --> 00:45:31,828
He's erect!

430
00:45:31,863 --> 00:45:33,295
He's erect!

431
00:45:33,330 --> 00:45:35,332
The bastard's got an erection!

432
00:45:35,367 --> 00:45:38,324
He's erect!

433
00:45:52,349 --> 00:45:54,351
You scumbag!

434
00:45:54,386 --> 00:45:56,865
I have to pee.

435
00:45:56,900 --> 00:45:59,345
Get outta here.

436
00:47:32,449 --> 00:47:35,441
Hei.

437
00:47:37,454 --> 00:47:39,421
Talking to me?

438
00:47:39,456 --> 00:47:41,458
Haven't we met somewhere before?

439
00:47:41,493 --> 00:47:43,425
Forget it, kid.

440
00:47:43,460 --> 00:47:46,452
You're not old enough for this.

441
00:47:52,469 --> 00:47:54,436
Wait, don't go!

442
00:47:54,471 --> 00:47:56,473
Don't you live in that building?

443
00:47:56,508 --> 00:47:58,475
Do you go to school down the street?

444
00:47:58,510 --> 00:47:59,441
Yes, I've seen you.

445
00:47:59,476 --> 00:48:00,477
at the door of the police station.

446
00:48:00,512 --> 00:48:03,480
You were with a policewoman.

447
00:48:03,515 --> 00:48:04,999
Can we be friends?

448
00:48:05,034 --> 00:48:06,259
Is that necessary?

449
00:48:06,294 --> 00:48:08,385
I don't think so.

450
00:48:08,420 --> 00:48:10,476
Why not be friends?

451
00:48:13,490 --> 00:48:15,457
You're obviously a very bad boy.

452
00:48:15,492 --> 00:48:17,494
Can't we just get to know each other?

453
00:48:17,529 --> 00:48:19,461
Be an elder sister to me.

454
00:48:19,496 --> 00:48:22,488
Find your elder sisters elsewhere.

455
00:48:25,502 --> 00:48:28,494
If you won't be friends, I'll...

456
00:48:30,507 --> 00:48:32,008
You'll what?

457
00:48:32,043 --> 00:48:33,510
Beat me up?

458
00:48:33,545 --> 00:48:35,524
Yeah.

459
00:48:35,559 --> 00:48:37,503
Really?

460
00:48:41,518 --> 00:48:44,510
You really think if we fought you'd win?

461
00:49:04,541 --> 00:49:07,509
Kid,

462
00:49:07,544 --> 00:49:10,536
come over here.

463
00:49:12,549 --> 00:49:13,550
How old are you?

464
00:49:13,585 --> 00:49:16,542
sixteen.

465
00:49:17,554 --> 00:49:20,522
Let me look at you.

466
00:49:20,557 --> 00:49:22,058
No way you're sixteen, liar!

467
00:49:22,093 --> 00:49:23,560
And you? How old are you?

468
00:49:23,595 --> 00:49:25,527
Older than you.

469
00:49:25,562 --> 00:49:28,565
Still want me to be your elder sister?

470
00:49:28,600 --> 00:49:31,085
Yes! How can I put it...

471
00:49:31,120 --> 00:49:33,570
you're just like my sister.

472
00:49:33,605 --> 00:49:34,571
You have a sister?

473
00:49:34,606 --> 00:49:36,538
No.

474
00:49:36,573 --> 00:49:37,574
What's your name?

475
00:49:37,609 --> 00:49:39,093
Ma Xiaojun.

476
00:49:39,128 --> 00:49:40,542
Really.

477
00:49:40,577 --> 00:49:43,079
It's here on my book bag.

478
00:49:43,114 --> 00:49:45,582
I'm not lying, and you?

479
00:49:45,617 --> 00:49:47,549
Mi Lan.

480
00:49:47,584 --> 00:49:49,586
You're Mi Lan?

481
00:49:49,621 --> 00:49:51,553
So?

482
00:49:51,588 --> 00:49:53,590
Nothing. Uh, you don't
spend much time at home?

483
00:49:53,625 --> 00:49:54,556
How do you know?

484
00:49:54,591 --> 00:49:57,594
You live at No.5. I've
been to you building.

485
00:49:57,629 --> 00:50:00,562
Go home...

486
00:50:00,597 --> 00:50:02,599
before you get into
trouble with your parents.

487
00:50:02,634 --> 00:50:05,591
Go home.

488
00:50:07,604 --> 00:50:10,596
But I've still got something to say.

489
00:50:38,635 --> 00:50:41,627
There's something I forgot.

490
00:50:42,639 --> 00:50:45,631
Uh, have you been to Beihai Park?

491
00:50:50,647 --> 00:50:52,649
Nice try but forget it...

492
00:50:52,684 --> 00:50:55,617
kid.

493
00:50:55,652 --> 00:50:57,654
Time to little children to go home.

494
00:50:57,689 --> 00:50:59,621
So...

495
00:50:59,656 --> 00:51:02,648
you will be my elder sister?

496
00:51:03,660 --> 00:51:04,661
Only if you do as I say.

497
00:51:04,696 --> 00:51:05,627
I promise.

498
00:51:05,662 --> 00:51:06,663
Ok, then run off home now.

499
00:51:06,698 --> 00:51:08,630
OK!

500
00:51:08,665 --> 00:51:11,657
And no more picking
up girls on the street!

501
00:51:13,670 --> 00:51:16,662
I swear before Chairman
Mao this was my first time.

502
00:51:17,674 --> 00:51:19,641
Bye!

503
00:51:19,676 --> 00:51:22,668
Uh, can I really come visit you?

504
00:51:31,688 --> 00:51:34,691
You really are your father's son, you!

505
00:51:34,726 --> 00:51:36,210
He's never at home...

506
00:51:36,245 --> 00:51:37,659
and neither are you.

507
00:51:37,694 --> 00:51:39,696
You treat this place like a hotel...

508
00:51:39,731 --> 00:51:41,663
and me like a maid.

509
00:51:41,698 --> 00:51:44,701
Aren't you something else!

510
00:51:44,736 --> 00:51:47,693
Get me some water.

511
00:51:50,707 --> 00:51:53,675
And a bowl!

512
00:51:53,710 --> 00:51:56,702
Trying to scald me to death?!

513
00:51:57,714 --> 00:51:58,680
No.

514
00:51:58,715 --> 00:52:00,717
You make me so angry.

515
00:52:00,752 --> 00:52:01,718
No, Mom.

516
00:52:02,719 --> 00:52:05,687
I'll kill you.

517
00:52:05,722 --> 00:52:06,723
I'm going to give you a beating!

518
00:52:06,758 --> 00:52:08,242
No, Mom.

519
00:52:08,277 --> 00:52:09,726
Don't, Ma.

520
00:52:10,727 --> 00:52:12,228
No, don't hit me.

521
00:52:12,263 --> 00:52:13,695
You're never here.

522
00:52:13,730 --> 00:52:16,722
You're never home, you
little son of a bitch.

523
00:52:20,737 --> 00:52:23,729
You little son of a bitch.

524
00:52:25,742 --> 00:52:28,734
You hang out with those bad kids.

525
00:52:29,746 --> 00:52:32,738
One day I know you'll end up in jail.

526
00:52:34,751 --> 00:52:37,743
and no one will sympathize.

527
00:52:39,756 --> 00:52:42,759
This is a letter from your teacher.

528
00:52:42,794 --> 00:52:45,751
Read it. Read it!

529
00:52:46,763 --> 00:52:48,730
Other children...

530
00:52:48,765 --> 00:52:51,768
come home to do their
homework after school.

531
00:52:51,803 --> 00:52:52,734
But you?

532
00:52:52,769 --> 00:52:54,771
It's dark and you're still not home!

533
00:52:54,806 --> 00:52:57,763
What's going on, huh?!

534
00:53:01,778 --> 00:53:02,744
Why don't you...

535
00:53:02,779 --> 00:53:05,782
be exactly like your father...

536
00:53:05,817 --> 00:53:06,783
and never come home?

537
00:53:06,818 --> 00:53:08,785
Get out, go!

538
00:53:08,820 --> 00:53:11,753
Go!

539
00:53:11,788 --> 00:53:12,754
You're free.

540
00:53:12,789 --> 00:53:15,781
Go visit the police whenever.

541
00:53:16,793 --> 00:53:19,796
Why don't you just
move directly to jail?!

542
00:53:37,814 --> 00:53:40,806
I'm an educated women...

543
00:53:42,819 --> 00:53:45,811
with a proper upbringing.

544
00:53:46,823 --> 00:53:49,325
but I've been a "dependent"...

545
00:53:49,360 --> 00:53:51,828
since your dad joined the army.

546
00:53:51,863 --> 00:53:54,820
Is that all I deserve? Me?

547
00:53:55,832 --> 00:53:58,824
I'm so furious... I'd like
to burn down the house.

548
00:53:59,836 --> 00:54:02,839
I can see your father
in you and you in him.

549
00:54:04,841 --> 00:54:07,833
Peas out of the same rotten pod you are.

550
00:54:09,846 --> 00:54:11,848
If you were a chicken,

551
00:54:13,850 --> 00:54:15,852
I wouldn't even eat your meat.

552
00:54:15,887 --> 00:54:18,820
I hate you that much.

553
00:54:18,855 --> 00:54:21,847
You hate me too, don't you...

554
00:54:22,859 --> 00:54:25,851
When have you ever done
anything to make me proud?

555
00:54:28,865 --> 00:54:30,832
You disappoint me.

556
00:54:30,867 --> 00:54:33,870
I regret ever having had you.

557
00:54:33,905 --> 00:54:36,862
You bastard.

558
00:54:39,876 --> 00:54:41,878
I never hit or cursed anyone...

559
00:54:44,881 --> 00:54:47,873
before your father and you came along.

560
00:54:48,885 --> 00:54:49,851
Turtle spawn!

561
00:54:49,886 --> 00:54:52,878
Get out of here! Oh! Aaah!

562
00:55:06,903 --> 00:55:09,895
In a fit of anger, my mother
gave birth to my brother.

563
00:55:10,907 --> 00:55:13,910
My mates took her to the army hospital...

564
00:55:13,945 --> 00:55:15,912
on the back of a bicycle cart.

565
00:55:15,947 --> 00:55:17,879
'cause the driver...

566
00:55:17,914 --> 00:55:19,916
couldn't get the jeep started.

567
00:55:19,951 --> 00:55:21,883
I thought.

568
00:55:21,918 --> 00:55:22,919
what sort of war-preparedness is this?

569
00:55:22,954 --> 00:55:25,922
An attack by the imperialists...

570
00:55:25,957 --> 00:55:28,890
and we'd be dead meat.

571
00:55:28,925 --> 00:55:31,922
Ma always cursed Dad
when she was beating me.

572
00:55:31,957 --> 00:55:34,920
but her curses brought
him home this time.

573
00:55:36,933 --> 00:55:39,430
When I got older I realized
my brother's birth...

574
00:55:39,465 --> 00:55:41,927
had to do with my breaking
into Dad's drawer...

575
00:55:43,940 --> 00:55:46,932
and puncturing that big balloon.

576
00:56:05,962 --> 00:56:08,954
That kid from Liutiao was
in hospital for a month.

577
00:56:09,966 --> 00:56:11,968
His mates sent word...

578
00:56:12,003 --> 00:56:13,935
that...

579
00:56:13,970 --> 00:56:14,971
there'd be a rumble on Monday...

580
00:56:15,006 --> 00:56:16,938
at the Marco Polo Bridge.

581
00:56:16,973 --> 00:56:19,475
We could each take 100 people.

582
00:56:19,510 --> 00:56:21,943
I couldn't help feeling nervous...

583
00:56:21,978 --> 00:56:24,981
and regretted trying so much
to be a hero with that brick.

584
00:56:25,016 --> 00:56:27,973
They demanded my participation.

585
00:56:28,985 --> 00:56:30,486
My thoughts turned to Mi Lan.

586
00:56:30,521 --> 00:56:32,750
I had to see her immediately.

587
00:56:32,785 --> 00:56:34,980
Maybe it would be the last time.

588
00:57:33,049 --> 00:57:34,050
The bastard's here. Let me go see him.

589
00:57:34,085 --> 00:57:36,570
What for?

590
00:57:36,605 --> 00:57:39,020
Act smart...

591
00:57:39,055 --> 00:57:42,047
and watch for my signal.

592
00:57:43,059 --> 00:57:45,061
Are you Ma Xiaojun?

593
00:57:45,096 --> 00:57:46,027
Yeah!

594
00:57:46,062 --> 00:57:48,064
Was it you who hit him with a brick?

595
00:57:48,099 --> 00:57:51,056
yes.

596
00:58:54,130 --> 00:58:56,132
The rumble never got underway...

597
00:58:56,167 --> 00:58:58,099
despite all the planning.

598
00:58:58,134 --> 00:58:59,135
We went to the old Moscow Restaurant.

599
00:59:15,151 --> 00:59:18,154
Brothers of the 4 Seas & 5 Continents...

600
00:59:18,189 --> 00:59:21,157
the supreme virtue is
- unity!

601
00:59:21,192 --> 00:59:23,171
Cheers!

602
00:59:23,206 --> 00:59:25,150
Cheers!

603
00:59:58,194 --> 01:00:00,696
I discovered a rule.

604
01:00:00,731 --> 01:00:02,465
With a dozen people...

605
01:00:02,500 --> 01:00:04,165
you can fight to death.

606
01:00:04,200 --> 01:00:07,192
With hundreds involved,
the fight never gets going.

607
01:00:08,204 --> 01:00:09,205
'Cause the more you drag in...

608
01:00:09,240 --> 01:00:11,172
the more likely it is...

609
01:00:11,207 --> 01:00:13,209
that the same people will
be friendly with both sides.

610
01:00:13,244 --> 01:00:14,175
So it was this time.

611
01:00:14,210 --> 01:00:17,202
We'd both gone for the
most fared bully in Peking.

612
01:00:18,214 --> 01:00:20,181
He had an awesome reputation.

613
01:00:20,216 --> 01:00:23,208
and everyone talked about
his underhanded ways.

614
01:00:24,220 --> 01:00:26,187
This was my first...

615
01:00:26,222 --> 01:00:29,225
and last encounter with him.

616
01:00:29,260 --> 01:00:30,191
He was later...

617
01:00:30,226 --> 01:00:33,218
killed by teenage punks who
wanted to take his place.

618
01:00:35,231 --> 01:00:37,233
All I remember is that
his hand was so soft,

619
01:00:37,268 --> 01:00:40,225
it was like a girl's.

620
01:00:42,238 --> 01:00:44,205
So I got off without a scratch.

621
01:00:44,240 --> 01:00:46,242
But something else was
driving me completely mad.

622
01:00:46,277 --> 01:00:48,244
Mi Lan seemed to be avoiding me.

623
01:00:55,251 --> 01:00:58,248
Mi Lan.

624
01:00:58,283 --> 01:01:01,246
Mi Lan!

625
01:01:03,259 --> 01:01:06,251
Mi Lan!

626
01:01:07,263 --> 01:01:10,255
Who's there?

627
01:01:13,269 --> 01:01:16,266
Oh, it's you.

628
01:01:16,301 --> 01:01:19,264
Come over here.

629
01:01:39,295 --> 01:01:40,296
Why aren't you in school?

630
01:01:40,331 --> 01:01:41,262
Uh...

631
01:01:41,297 --> 01:01:44,289
Teacher's sick. We're having
study period. I snuck out.

632
01:01:45,301 --> 01:01:47,303
Have you been by before?

633
01:01:47,338 --> 01:01:49,270
No.

634
01:01:49,305 --> 01:01:52,273
Hmph, Why not?

635
01:01:52,308 --> 01:01:54,310
I've been busy with...

636
01:01:54,345 --> 01:01:55,829
end of term exams...

637
01:01:55,864 --> 01:01:57,589
I haven't had any time.

638
01:01:57,624 --> 01:01:59,315
I've been really busy.

639
01:01:59,350 --> 01:02:01,282
Really busy.

640
01:02:01,317 --> 01:02:04,285
And I was thinking...

641
01:02:04,320 --> 01:02:07,288
where he's disappeared to?

642
01:02:07,323 --> 01:02:09,325
Off meeting other "elder sister"?

643
01:02:10,326 --> 01:02:13,318
No, no.

644
01:02:17,333 --> 01:02:19,300
So...

645
01:02:19,335 --> 01:02:22,338
have you met anyone new lately?

646
01:02:23,339 --> 01:02:26,342
Seems like I've nothing better to do!

647
01:02:29,345 --> 01:02:32,337
No, definitely not.

648
01:02:35,351 --> 01:02:38,319
OK!

649
01:02:38,354 --> 01:02:40,356
Give me a hand, would you?

650
01:02:40,391 --> 01:02:41,322
Sure.

651
01:02:41,357 --> 01:02:44,349
Fetch that kettle from the hallway?

652
01:02:45,361 --> 01:02:46,362
Careful, don't burn yourself.

653
01:02:46,397 --> 01:02:49,354
No problem. Don't worry.

654
01:03:01,377 --> 01:03:02,378
Let me help you rinse it.

655
01:03:02,413 --> 01:03:04,345
Thanks.

656
01:03:04,380 --> 01:03:05,381
Put in a bit of cold water first.

657
01:03:15,391 --> 01:03:17,387
Oh, Ok. Too hot?

658
01:03:17,422 --> 01:03:19,384
No, go ahead!

659
01:03:45,421 --> 01:03:46,387
It's so hot.

660
01:03:46,422 --> 01:03:47,423
And summer's barely begun.

661
01:03:47,458 --> 01:03:49,425
Can you swim?

662
01:03:49,460 --> 01:03:50,391
No.

663
01:03:50,426 --> 01:03:51,392
And you?

664
01:03:51,427 --> 01:03:53,429
Yes, I'll show you some day.

665
01:03:53,464 --> 01:03:54,395
Great.

666
01:03:54,430 --> 01:03:56,397
If I fall in...

667
01:03:56,432 --> 01:03:57,433
you can save me then?

668
01:03:57,468 --> 01:03:58,399
You bet...

669
01:03:58,434 --> 01:04:01,437
though you're a bit big for me so
I'll have to work out a bit first.

670
01:04:01,472 --> 01:04:03,439
Every day, in Shisha Lake.

671
01:04:03,474 --> 01:04:05,406
What about school?

672
01:04:05,441 --> 01:04:06,442
When I finish with exams, we...

673
01:04:06,477 --> 01:04:07,408
Put it over there.

674
01:04:07,443 --> 01:04:10,435
Yeah, we can go there together.

675
01:04:13,449 --> 01:04:16,441
Stand there, don't move.

676
01:04:18,454 --> 01:04:19,420
OK.

677
01:04:19,455 --> 01:04:21,457
What are you studying?

678
01:04:21,492 --> 01:04:23,476
Studying?

679
01:04:23,511 --> 01:04:25,426
Dunno...

680
01:04:25,461 --> 01:04:28,453
I mean, how to make wine...

681
01:04:29,465 --> 01:04:30,431
and, uh, violins...

682
01:04:30,466 --> 01:04:33,434
sesame paste, stuff like that.

683
01:04:33,469 --> 01:04:35,471
Where do you learn those silly things?

684
01:04:35,506 --> 01:04:36,437
From the workers and peasants!

685
01:04:36,472 --> 01:04:39,475
We worked for a month
in the wine factory,

686
01:04:39,510 --> 01:04:41,477
got into a big fight there,

687
01:04:41,512 --> 01:04:42,996
200 of them,

688
01:04:43,031 --> 01:04:44,445
but we won,

689
01:04:44,480 --> 01:04:46,482
and now we always carry
cleavers in our book bags.

690
01:04:46,517 --> 01:04:48,484
This older kid was begging for mercy,

691
01:04:48,519 --> 01:04:51,487
but we slashed him up anyway.

692
01:04:51,522 --> 01:04:54,455
Really?

693
01:04:54,490 --> 01:04:56,992
So what do they test you on?

694
01:04:57,027 --> 01:04:59,495
Wine-making or fighting?

695
01:04:59,530 --> 01:05:00,513
Sit down.

696
01:05:00,548 --> 01:05:01,462
You kidding?

697
01:05:01,497 --> 01:05:03,464
We were only there one month.

698
01:05:03,499 --> 01:05:05,501
the rest of the time
we're in the classroom.

699
01:05:05,536 --> 01:05:07,468
I like reading.

700
01:05:07,503 --> 01:05:09,505
What sort of books do you like?

701
01:05:09,540 --> 01:05:11,507
How Steel Is Tempered,

702
01:05:11,542 --> 01:05:13,474
Gadfly,

703
01:05:13,509 --> 01:05:16,501
The Song of Youth, Bitter
Blossoms, that sort of thing.

704
01:05:18,514 --> 01:05:20,516
Do you like the heroine Dunya?

705
01:05:20,551 --> 01:05:21,482
I like Pavel,

706
01:05:21,517 --> 01:05:23,018
but I like Dunya too.

707
01:05:23,053 --> 01:05:24,787
Pity how she changed...

708
01:05:24,822 --> 01:05:26,487
and became bourgeois.

709
01:05:26,522 --> 01:05:28,524
Have you finished all those books? No.

710
01:05:28,559 --> 01:05:29,490
Why not?

711
01:05:29,525 --> 01:05:32,517
They're just old books
without beginning or end.

712
01:05:33,529 --> 01:05:35,531
What about "200 Songs"? You read that?

713
01:05:35,566 --> 01:05:37,498
Of course!

714
01:05:37,533 --> 01:05:40,536
200 Folk Songs from Abroad.

715
01:05:40,571 --> 01:05:43,528
It's a songbook.

716
01:05:45,541 --> 01:05:48,533
I can't read music, I
just read the lyrics.

717
01:05:49,545 --> 01:05:51,547
Why don't you teach me to sing them?

718
01:05:51,582 --> 01:05:54,539
Sure, no problem.

719
01:06:02,558 --> 01:06:03,559
Where do you work?

720
01:06:03,594 --> 01:06:04,525
Really far away.

721
01:06:04,560 --> 01:06:05,561
So why aren't you there?

722
01:06:05,596 --> 01:06:08,529
I'm just back,

723
01:06:08,564 --> 01:06:09,530
I usually stay there.

724
01:06:09,565 --> 01:06:12,557
That's why you're never home.

725
01:06:14,570 --> 01:06:15,571
So you have come to see me?

726
01:06:15,606 --> 01:06:16,589
No.

727
01:06:16,624 --> 01:06:17,538
Liar.

728
01:06:17,573 --> 01:06:19,074
My grandma told me you've been by.

729
01:06:19,109 --> 01:06:21,338
A kid would call out "Mi Lan"...

730
01:06:21,373 --> 01:06:23,568
and run when she opened the door.

731
01:06:27,583 --> 01:06:29,585
That wasn't me.

732
01:06:29,620 --> 01:06:31,104
Really.

733
01:06:31,139 --> 01:06:32,553
Fine.

734
01:06:32,588 --> 01:06:34,590
Anyway, I'm on sick leave.

735
01:06:34,625 --> 01:06:36,557
Come visit anytime.

736
01:06:36,592 --> 01:06:39,584
What's wrong? Mind your own business.

737
01:06:43,599 --> 01:06:46,602
Isn't there a photo of
you in a bathing suit?

738
01:06:46,637 --> 01:06:47,568
Nonsense!

739
01:06:47,603 --> 01:06:49,570
When have I ever worn a bathing suit?

740
01:06:49,605 --> 01:06:51,572
It was hanging right
there. I'm sure of it.

741
01:06:51,607 --> 01:06:54,610
There was a photo, but I
wasn't in a bathing suit.

742
01:06:54,645 --> 01:06:55,611
Impossible! Show it to me.

743
01:06:55,646 --> 01:06:57,578
A friend took it.

744
01:06:57,613 --> 01:07:00,616
I'm positive you were in a bathing suit.

745
01:07:00,651 --> 01:07:03,608
Such a stubborn kid!

746
01:07:04,620 --> 01:07:07,588
Want to see?

747
01:07:07,623 --> 01:07:10,615
Strange! I'm so sure.

748
01:07:12,628 --> 01:07:15,620
Really?

749
01:07:18,634 --> 01:07:20,601
Just like this one,

750
01:07:20,636 --> 01:07:23,639
but with a bathing suit.

751
01:07:23,674 --> 01:07:25,606
No?

752
01:07:25,641 --> 01:07:26,607
Hanging right here?

753
01:07:26,642 --> 01:07:28,644
Just tell me this, am I
wearing a bathing suit?

754
01:07:28,679 --> 01:07:31,164
No, you're not.

755
01:07:31,199 --> 01:07:33,614
I don't get it.

756
01:07:33,649 --> 01:07:36,652
It was hanging there, I
remember it was in color.

757
01:07:36,687 --> 01:07:39,620
OK...

758
01:07:39,655 --> 01:07:41,657
why don't you a photo
of me like that sometime?

759
01:07:41,692 --> 01:07:42,623
OK.

760
01:07:42,658 --> 01:07:44,660
Can I keep this one?

761
01:07:44,695 --> 01:07:45,626
No.

762
01:07:45,661 --> 01:07:46,662
Come on.

763
01:07:46,697 --> 01:07:47,628
No.

764
01:07:47,663 --> 01:07:49,665
Why do you want my photo anyway?

765
01:07:49,700 --> 01:07:51,667
You really won't give it to me?

766
01:07:51,702 --> 01:07:52,668
Then I'll steal it.

767
01:07:52,703 --> 01:07:55,683
You'd dare!

768
01:07:55,718 --> 01:07:58,663
Stop it!

769
01:08:16,340 --> 01:08:19,330
Angry?

770
01:08:20,340 --> 01:08:22,310
Don't be. really...

771
01:08:22,340 --> 01:08:24,340
it's not good to take girls' photos.

772
01:08:24,380 --> 01:08:27,340
Come over here.

773
01:08:41,360 --> 01:08:43,360
I've got something for you.

774
01:08:43,400 --> 01:08:46,370
Come here.

775
01:08:46,400 --> 01:08:49,330
Here.

776
01:08:49,370 --> 01:08:52,360
It's got three colors.

777
01:09:02,380 --> 01:09:05,390
I saw her practically every day.

778
01:09:05,420 --> 01:09:06,350
To make myself look good...

779
01:09:06,390 --> 01:09:09,390
I'd claim credit for things
other people had done...

780
01:09:09,420 --> 01:09:11,410
exaggerating and padding...

781
01:09:11,440 --> 01:09:13,390
out the stories with abandon.

782
01:09:13,430 --> 01:09:14,360
My alleged evil deeds...

783
01:09:14,390 --> 01:09:17,390
matched neither my
actual age or experience.

784
01:09:18,400 --> 01:09:21,390
She encouraged me, never looking
shocked at anything I said.

785
01:09:22,400 --> 01:09:24,400
I told her how I'd
learned how to make keys...

786
01:09:24,440 --> 01:09:26,370
and pick locks...

787
01:09:26,410 --> 01:09:27,410
and broken into her house...

788
01:09:29,410 --> 01:09:31,380
and seen her photo...

789
01:09:31,410 --> 01:09:34,400
and all she said was, "Really"?

790
01:09:35,420 --> 01:09:38,380
Sometimes she'd fall asleep,

791
01:09:38,420 --> 01:09:41,410
and I'd try my hardest
not to stare at her body,

792
01:09:42,420 --> 01:09:45,430
and keep my thoughts under control.

793
01:09:45,460 --> 01:09:46,390
But wait...

794
01:09:46,430 --> 01:09:48,390
My memory plays tricks.

795
01:09:48,430 --> 01:09:50,400
I've confused reality and dreams.

796
01:09:50,430 --> 01:09:53,420
Maybe she never fell
asleep in front of me.

797
01:09:54,430 --> 01:09:56,440
She may never have
stared at me like that.

798
01:09:56,470 --> 01:09:58,400
Heavens! If not, Why is her gaze...

799
01:09:58,440 --> 01:10:01,430
and her sleeping figure so
deeply etched in my brain?

800
01:10:29,470 --> 01:10:31,440
I passed my last exam...

801
01:10:31,470 --> 01:10:34,460
and holidays were beginning in two days.

802
01:10:41,480 --> 01:10:44,470
You shop for groceries?
Like a little housewife.

803
01:10:46,490 --> 01:10:48,450
A housewife I am then.

804
01:10:48,490 --> 01:10:51,460
How else am I supposed to eat?

805
01:10:51,490 --> 01:10:53,490
We go on vacation day after tomorrow.

806
01:10:53,530 --> 01:10:54,490
How wonderful to be a student.

807
01:10:54,530 --> 01:10:56,460
Two holidays a year.

808
01:10:56,500 --> 01:10:59,490
But if I don't go to school, I
might not be able to come every day.

809
01:11:03,500 --> 01:11:04,470
Come on up.

810
01:11:04,500 --> 01:11:07,470
No, I have to go.

811
01:11:07,510 --> 01:11:09,510
I've been here all afternoon.

812
01:11:09,540 --> 01:11:12,480
Really? What's up?

813
01:11:12,510 --> 01:11:15,500
Uh, when are you coming to visit me?

814
01:11:16,520 --> 01:11:17,480
I'm not.

815
01:11:17,520 --> 01:11:20,490
I've no desire to meet
that gang of bad kids.

816
01:11:20,520 --> 01:11:23,510
You haven't met them, how
do you know they're bad?

817
01:11:24,520 --> 01:11:25,490
Really,

818
01:11:25,530 --> 01:11:27,530
they're a lot of fun.

819
01:11:27,560 --> 01:11:29,050
Some other time.

820
01:11:29,080 --> 01:11:30,500
That's no good.

821
01:11:30,530 --> 01:11:32,530
how will we get in touch?

822
01:11:32,570 --> 01:11:34,500
Let's set a day now.

823
01:11:34,530 --> 01:11:36,540
All right, then. What day's good?

824
01:11:36,570 --> 01:11:39,530
Monday. Fewer adults around.

825
01:11:40,540 --> 01:11:41,510
OK.

826
01:11:41,540 --> 01:11:43,510
This is a map.

827
01:11:43,540 --> 01:11:45,550
Just follow the arrow
and you'll find it.

828
01:11:45,580 --> 01:11:48,550
I'll be at the gate.

829
01:11:48,580 --> 01:11:51,540
OK.

830
01:12:00,560 --> 01:12:03,530
Give me a cigarette.

831
01:12:03,560 --> 01:12:05,570
Why don't you buy it yourself?

832
01:12:10,570 --> 01:12:12,570
Just one, please.

833
01:12:12,610 --> 01:12:13,540
Go play.

834
01:12:13,570 --> 01:12:14,540
Smoke at the gate...

835
01:12:14,570 --> 01:12:16,580
just like a heavy smoker.

836
01:12:16,610 --> 01:12:19,580
Don't smoke here.

837
01:12:26,590 --> 01:12:28,590
Is she really coming or is this a trick?

838
01:12:28,620 --> 01:12:31,580
Yeah, Monkey, you've been had.

839
01:12:32,590 --> 01:12:35,580
Maybe she's not even Mi Lan.

840
01:12:42,600 --> 01:12:44,570
Why don't you wait inside

841
01:12:44,600 --> 01:12:47,600
and stop clogging up the view?

842
01:12:47,640 --> 01:12:50,600
OK, we'll be behind the hill.

843
01:12:55,620 --> 01:12:56,620
Let's go. Gu Lunmu!

844
01:12:56,650 --> 01:12:57,620
Ouba!

845
01:13:00,620 --> 01:13:02,590
Ouba!

846
01:13:02,620 --> 01:13:06,620
Can I stay here with you, Monkey?

847
01:13:06,630 --> 01:13:09,620
If you behave.

848
01:13:10,630 --> 01:13:13,600
What's she look like? Pretty?

849
01:13:13,630 --> 01:13:15,600
Why don't you just go with the others?

850
01:13:15,640 --> 01:13:18,630
No, tell me, I can help
you look out for her.

851
01:13:21,640 --> 01:13:24,640
Hey!

852
01:13:37,660 --> 01:13:40,650
That her? Yes.

853
01:13:42,660 --> 01:13:45,650
Why'd you come from that direction?

854
01:13:46,670 --> 01:13:51,670
I got lost cause of your dumb map.

855
01:13:56,680 --> 01:13:58,640
This way.

856
01:13:58,680 --> 01:14:01,670
They're waiting by the pavilion.

857
01:14:02,680 --> 01:14:05,650
I've seen you before.

858
01:14:05,690 --> 01:14:08,690
You work at the same farm as Yu Beipei.

859
01:14:08,720 --> 01:14:11,680
Yes.

860
01:14:17,700 --> 01:14:19,700
We're good friends with Yu Beipei.

861
01:14:19,730 --> 01:14:21,670
Really?

862
01:14:21,700 --> 01:14:24,670
She knows a lot of people.

863
01:14:24,700 --> 01:14:26,710
This is Liu Yiku, whom
I've told you about.

864
01:14:26,740 --> 01:14:28,710
This is his brother Liu Sitian.

865
01:14:28,740 --> 01:14:29,730
This is Big Ant,

866
01:14:29,760 --> 01:14:30,740
you've just met.

867
01:14:30,770 --> 01:14:32,240
Where's Yang Gao?

868
01:14:32,280 --> 01:14:35,000
Buying ice-pops.

869
01:14:35,030 --> 01:14:37,710
They're all my pals.

870
01:14:39,720 --> 01:14:41,720
Not a bad place you live in.

871
01:14:41,760 --> 01:14:43,740
Give me a hand, Ant.

872
01:14:43,780 --> 01:14:45,690
This is Yang Gao.

873
01:14:45,730 --> 01:14:48,220
What took you so long?

874
01:14:48,260 --> 01:14:50,720
This is Mi Lan. Hi.

875
01:14:52,730 --> 01:14:53,700
Have an ice-pop.

876
01:14:53,730 --> 01:14:56,730
Thanks, I was dying of thirst.

877
01:14:57,740 --> 01:15:00,740
It's dangerous to come this way?

878
01:15:00,780 --> 01:15:03,710
It's a short cut.

879
01:15:03,740 --> 01:15:06,750
Know which film's on tonight?

880
01:15:06,780 --> 01:15:07,710
Which?

881
01:15:07,750 --> 01:15:08,750
"Lenin in 1918".

882
01:15:08,780 --> 01:15:09,710
Really?

883
01:15:09,750 --> 01:15:12,250
Great. Vasily!

884
01:15:12,280 --> 01:15:14,740
Quick, take this.

885
01:15:21,760 --> 01:15:22,760
Quick go tell Kerenshy...

886
01:15:22,800 --> 01:15:24,280
Bukharin

887
01:15:24,320 --> 01:15:25,730
Trotsky

888
01:15:25,770 --> 01:15:27,730
are traitors.

889
01:15:27,770 --> 01:15:29,770
They want to assassinate Lenin.

890
01:15:29,800 --> 01:15:32,760
It's all right. BANG BANG!

891
01:15:34,770 --> 01:15:37,770
Bastard, die already. BANG!

892
01:15:38,780 --> 01:15:40,780
That girl really looks an old trooper,

893
01:15:40,820 --> 01:15:42,780
her ass is round from too much fucking.

894
01:15:42,820 --> 01:15:45,770
I'll kill you!

895
01:15:51,790 --> 01:15:52,790
Do you think she's good looking?

896
01:15:52,830 --> 01:15:53,760
You bet.

897
01:15:53,790 --> 01:15:56,790
Have you made a move yet?

898
01:15:57,800 --> 01:15:59,760
What d'ya reckon?

899
01:15:59,800 --> 01:16:02,800
Get one for me, too, please.

900
01:16:02,840 --> 01:16:05,790
Please? One for me too?

901
01:16:09,810 --> 01:16:11,780
Get up!

902
01:16:11,810 --> 01:16:14,310
Shit, hold it right there!

903
01:16:14,350 --> 01:16:16,780
If only you could play violin.

904
01:16:16,820 --> 01:16:18,820
My dad's cultural
troupe needs a violinist.

905
01:16:18,850 --> 01:16:20,820
Can't you play violin if you play pipe?

906
01:16:20,860 --> 01:16:21,790
They're different.

907
01:16:21,820 --> 01:16:24,820
You pluck one and use
a bow on the other.

908
01:16:24,820 --> 01:16:27,790
Mi Lan!

909
01:16:27,830 --> 01:16:29,830
Don't join his dad's
troupe whatever you do.

910
01:16:29,860 --> 01:16:32,800
His father would ravage you first off.

911
01:16:32,830 --> 01:16:35,330
Monkey. sure you're not
thinking of your dad?

912
01:16:35,370 --> 01:16:37,840
He's the one who got
demoted for bad... behavior.

913
01:16:37,870 --> 01:16:39,840
Your dad! It was yours!

914
01:16:39,870 --> 01:16:41,810
He has two wives.

915
01:16:41,840 --> 01:16:43,810
one in the country, and one here.

916
01:16:43,840 --> 01:16:46,840
That's why you're Sitian - "thinking sweetness"
and he's Yiku - "recalling bitterness".

917
01:16:47,850 --> 01:16:50,850
Monkey's insulting your
dad... shall we beat him up?

918
01:16:50,890 --> 01:16:51,850
Forget it, let's give
him a bit of face today.

919
01:16:51,890 --> 01:16:54,840
Enough, already, no need for panic.

920
01:16:56,860 --> 01:16:59,820
I'm not going to join the troupe today.

921
01:16:59,860 --> 01:17:01,360
So do you really want
to join the army? Yes.

922
01:17:01,400 --> 01:17:03,630
Try out for "The
Soldiers' Friends" troupe.

923
01:17:03,670 --> 01:17:05,830
I'm aiming for "Political Headquarters".

924
01:17:05,870 --> 01:17:07,870
Mi Lan, if you play the pipe,
you can play guitar, can't you?

925
01:17:07,900 --> 01:17:09,830
More or less.

926
01:17:09,870 --> 01:17:10,870
We've got a guitar. I'll go get it.

927
01:17:10,910 --> 01:17:12,870
Keep your pants on.

928
01:17:12,910 --> 01:17:14,840
I want to fly!

929
01:17:14,870 --> 01:17:20,880
I want to fly into the
skies all way to the Kremlin.

930
01:17:20,880 --> 01:17:23,870
To Leningrad.

931
01:17:25,890 --> 01:17:29,890
Fly! Fly!

932
01:17:29,890 --> 01:17:31,860
Why sit down?

933
01:17:31,890 --> 01:17:33,890
I want to ascend the heights
and revel in the view.

934
01:17:33,930 --> 01:17:34,890
Monkey seems a bit different today.

935
01:17:34,930 --> 01:17:36,900
He's talking all poetic.

936
01:17:36,930 --> 01:17:39,890
Really?

937
01:17:40,900 --> 01:17:42,870
Stop scaring us like that.

938
01:17:42,900 --> 01:17:44,900
Didn't he say he wanted
to ascend the heights?

939
01:17:44,940 --> 01:17:46,870
This isn't a "height"!

940
01:17:46,910 --> 01:17:48,910
Isn't there anyplace
higher in this compound?

941
01:17:48,940 --> 01:17:50,910
Yes, the smokestack over there.

942
01:17:50,950 --> 01:17:52,880
That's a height!

943
01:17:52,910 --> 01:17:54,910
Yang Gao, don't stir him up.

944
01:17:54,950 --> 01:17:55,930
Unless you want to try.

945
01:17:55,970 --> 01:17:56,880
You go and we'll watch.

946
01:17:56,920 --> 01:17:58,920
I didn't say I wanted
to ascend the heights.

947
01:17:58,950 --> 01:17:59,920
Has anyway ever climbed to the top?

948
01:17:59,950 --> 01:18:01,440
I have!

949
01:18:01,470 --> 01:18:02,890
Really!

950
01:18:02,920 --> 01:18:03,920
You're really something!

951
01:18:03,960 --> 01:18:05,440
Show us!

952
01:18:05,480 --> 01:18:06,890
Forget it.

953
01:18:06,930 --> 01:18:07,890
Come on, show her!

954
01:18:07,930 --> 01:18:09,930
We'll give you two packs of cigarettes.

955
01:18:09,960 --> 01:18:11,900
Get lost. Just two?

956
01:18:11,930 --> 01:18:13,930
Plus two packs of filters.

957
01:18:13,970 --> 01:18:15,450
There were four last time.

958
01:18:15,490 --> 01:18:16,900
But I've been up there before.

959
01:18:16,940 --> 01:18:18,900
A here doesn't bring up past glories.

960
01:18:18,940 --> 01:18:20,940
Don't rest on your laurels,
make new contributions!

961
01:18:20,980 --> 01:18:21,960
Why don't you do us?

962
01:18:21,990 --> 01:18:22,910
How about
this...

963
01:18:22,940 --> 01:18:23,940
four packs of filtertips,

964
01:18:23,980 --> 01:18:26,950
plus two of Cathay.

965
01:18:26,980 --> 01:18:30,960
Your serious?

966
01:18:31,000 --> 01:18:34,940
Ma Xiaojun!

967
01:18:37,960 --> 01:18:38,920
He's really going to do it!

968
01:18:38,960 --> 01:18:42,960
No way. He doesn't know
how to get up there.

969
01:18:43,000 --> 01:18:46,960
Rolls of barbed wire
are blocking the ladder.

970
01:18:46,970 --> 01:18:48,970
He's just trying to
scare us. Don't worry.

971
01:18:49,000 --> 01:18:51,960
He'll be back in no time.

972
01:18:52,970 --> 01:18:53,940
Vasily!

973
01:18:53,970 --> 01:18:56,970
There he is!

974
01:18:57,980 --> 01:19:06,980
Vasily! Vasily! Ha Ha!

975
01:19:08,990 --> 01:19:12,990
Get down from there, now!

976
01:19:12,990 --> 01:19:15,960
Vasily!

977
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:18,500
Don't be stupid! Monkey!

978
01:19:18,530 --> 01:19:21,000
Get down from there, now!

979
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:25,000
Coming!

980
01:19:25,040 --> 01:19:25,970
Shit!

981
01:19:26,010 --> 01:19:27,010
Here's another!

982
01:19:29,010 --> 01:19:31,010
Come down, Monkey!

983
01:19:31,050 --> 01:19:34,010
You mad?

984
01:19:34,010 --> 01:19:36,980
We're all excellent shots

985
01:19:37,020 --> 01:19:39,020
and each bullet takes down an enemy.

986
01:19:39,050 --> 01:19:41,020
Ma Xiaojun, where are you?

987
01:20:34,070 --> 01:20:35,070
Go buy my cigarettes!

988
01:20:35,110 --> 01:20:36,090
My cigarettes!

989
01:20:36,130 --> 01:20:38,100
My cigarettes!

990
01:20:38,130 --> 01:20:40,070
My cigarettes!

991
01:20:45,080 --> 01:20:47,580
Mi Lan, don't go away.

992
01:20:47,620 --> 01:20:50,080
Stay for the film tonight.

993
01:20:52,090 --> 01:20:55,060
Everyone said I was charmed.

994
01:20:55,090 --> 01:20:58,100
No one talked about
supernatural powers then...

995
01:20:58,130 --> 01:21:01,070
otherwise I'd have been famous.

996
01:21:01,100 --> 01:21:04,100
Later I figured out that
it was the upward draft

997
01:21:04,130 --> 01:21:07,100
and years of accumulated
ashes that saved my life.

998
01:21:11,110 --> 01:21:13,110
You scared us to death.

999
01:21:13,150 --> 01:21:15,110
You're not even scratched!

1000
01:21:15,150 --> 01:21:18,110
Amazing!

1001
01:21:23,120 --> 01:21:26,110
Cat got your tongue?

1002
01:21:29,130 --> 01:21:32,120
What a temper!

1003
01:21:34,130 --> 01:21:37,140
If you won't talk to me. I'll be off.

1004
01:21:37,170 --> 01:21:40,100
What temper?

1005
01:21:40,140 --> 01:21:43,130
So you really like
talking with strange boys?

1006
01:21:46,150 --> 01:21:47,150
What do you think?

1007
01:21:47,180 --> 01:21:50,140
Dunno.

1008
01:21:51,150 --> 01:21:54,140
I think you're jealous.

1009
01:21:55,150 --> 01:21:58,160
Come on, what sort of
girl do you think I am?

1010
01:21:58,190 --> 01:22:00,120
Who's jealous?

1011
01:22:00,160 --> 01:22:03,160
What were you talking
about with Liu Yiku, anyway?

1012
01:22:03,200 --> 01:22:05,130
Nothing!

1013
01:22:05,160 --> 01:22:08,670
About joining the
army, he said he'd help.

1014
01:22:08,700 --> 01:22:12,170
You never told me you
wanted to join the army.

1015
01:22:12,170 --> 01:22:15,170
You meet him once and
tell him everything.

1016
01:22:15,210 --> 01:22:18,140
Fast mover.

1017
01:22:18,180 --> 01:22:19,180
What was I supposed to do?

1018
01:22:19,210 --> 01:22:20,700
Just site there?

1019
01:22:20,730 --> 01:22:22,150
You ask me here,

1020
01:22:22,180 --> 01:22:24,150
and then you ignore me.

1021
01:22:24,180 --> 01:22:29,190
You just play heroes of "Lenin
in October" with Big Ant.

1022
01:22:29,190 --> 01:22:31,690
That's "Lenin in 1918".

1023
01:22:31,720 --> 01:22:34,180
Whatever, "Lenin in 1918".

1024
01:22:35,190 --> 01:22:38,190
But that's no excuse for ignoring me.

1025
01:22:41,200 --> 01:22:44,190
Oh, Dad?

1026
01:22:45,200 --> 01:22:46,710
Uh, this is my father.

1027
01:22:46,740 --> 01:22:48,210
This... this is...

1028
01:22:48,240 --> 01:22:49,730
Hello, Uncle.

1029
01:22:49,760 --> 01:22:51,180
Our teacher.

1030
01:22:51,210 --> 01:22:54,200
Oh, how do you do?

1031
01:22:55,210 --> 01:22:57,180
I'll be off then.

1032
01:22:57,220 --> 01:22:59,220
Bye, Ma Xiaojun, Uncle.

1033
01:22:59,250 --> 01:23:01,190
Bye.

1034
01:23:01,220 --> 01:23:04,190
Oh, little comrade,

1035
01:23:04,220 --> 01:23:05,220
What is your name again?

1036
01:23:05,260 --> 01:23:08,190
Mi Lan.

1037
01:23:08,230 --> 01:23:11,230
Is there anything else, sir?

1038
01:23:11,270 --> 01:23:12,250
Uh, no, that'll be all.

1039
01:23:12,280 --> 01:23:13,230
Then I'll be going. Bye!

1040
01:23:13,270 --> 01:23:16,230
Ok, bye.

1041
01:23:19,240 --> 01:23:21,210
Get my overcoat.

1042
01:23:21,240 --> 01:23:23,240
Why do you need that on such a hot day?

1043
01:23:23,280 --> 01:23:26,230
I said get my overcoat.

1044
01:23:37,260 --> 01:23:40,250
Here it is, Dad.

1045
01:23:42,260 --> 01:23:45,250
Sit down.

1046
01:23:53,270 --> 01:23:56,280
So where does this teacher
of yours really work?

1047
01:23:56,310 --> 01:23:59,280
She works... at our school.

1048
01:23:59,310 --> 01:24:00,280
New, is she?

1049
01:24:00,310 --> 01:24:03,250
Yes.

1050
01:24:03,280 --> 01:24:05,250
Where's she from?

1051
01:24:05,280 --> 01:24:07,290
Somewhere in the west city,

1052
01:24:07,320 --> 01:24:09,310
er, Xidan,

1053
01:24:09,340 --> 01:24:11,260
yeah, Xidan.

1054
01:24:11,290 --> 01:24:13,290
What does she teach?

1055
01:24:13,330 --> 01:24:15,310
Uh, a bit of everything.

1056
01:24:15,350 --> 01:24:17,260
She's making home visits,

1057
01:24:17,300 --> 01:24:20,300
probably seeing the others now.

1058
01:24:20,330 --> 01:24:21,270
Teacher my ass!

1059
01:24:21,300 --> 01:24:24,290
What teacher calls me "uncle"?

1060
01:24:25,300 --> 01:24:27,310
You'd lie to your old man?

1061
01:24:27,340 --> 01:24:28,270
You've get gall.

1062
01:24:28,310 --> 01:24:30,270
Take off that uniform.

1063
01:24:30,310 --> 01:24:34,310
Liar. I saw through you right away.

1064
01:24:35,310 --> 01:24:37,320
You're a bad student, disobedient,

1065
01:24:37,320 --> 01:24:39,320
and now you've got a girlfriend.

1066
01:24:39,350 --> 01:24:41,290
Girlfriend?

1067
01:24:41,320 --> 01:24:42,320
She just came to wash her face.

1068
01:24:42,360 --> 01:24:44,320
Wash her face?

1069
01:24:44,320 --> 01:24:47,330
You think I couldn't see her blushing?

1070
01:24:47,360 --> 01:24:49,330
Don't forget I'm your father.

1071
01:24:49,330 --> 01:24:51,300
I know everything.

1072
01:24:51,330 --> 01:24:54,320
If she's not your
girlfriend, what is she?

1073
01:24:56,340 --> 01:24:58,300
Puppy love!

1074
01:24:58,340 --> 01:25:00,840
That's not allowed.

1075
01:25:00,870 --> 01:25:03,310
Where's she from?

1076
01:25:03,340 --> 01:25:05,310
Forget it. I've no time for this.

1077
01:25:05,340 --> 01:25:09,350
Tell your mother I've been
sent to Inner Mongolia.

1078
01:25:09,350 --> 01:25:11,350
Urgent mission. War games.

1079
01:25:11,390 --> 01:25:12,350
When'll you be back?

1080
01:25:12,390 --> 01:25:14,320
In a month.

1081
01:25:14,350 --> 01:25:21,360
Don't get into mischief while I'm away.

1082
01:25:21,360 --> 01:25:22,360
Political Commissar Ma! Time to go!

1083
01:25:23,360 --> 01:25:27,360
Coming!

1084
01:25:27,370 --> 01:25:29,370
This is this month's salary.

1085
01:25:29,400 --> 01:25:31,370
Give it to your mother.

1086
01:25:31,410 --> 01:25:32,340
Don't upset her.

1087
01:25:32,370 --> 01:25:35,360
I'll say that once more.

1088
01:25:37,380 --> 01:25:39,380
Take two Yuan for yourself,

1089
01:25:39,410 --> 01:25:42,370
spend it carefully.

1090
01:25:44,380 --> 01:25:47,380
Don't go bringing girls back here.

1091
01:25:50,390 --> 01:25:53,380
Never lie to me again.

1092
01:25:55,390 --> 01:25:58,390
All right, I'm off.

1093
01:26:26,430 --> 01:26:38,420
Yang Gao! Yang Gao! Yang Gao!

1094
01:26:44,440 --> 01:26:46,950
Comrades, comrades, quiet down!

1095
01:26:46,980 --> 01:26:49,450
There's been a technical problem,

1096
01:26:51,450 --> 01:26:54,440
so we'll move to the
second film "Lenin in 1918".

1097
01:27:02,460 --> 01:27:07,460
Liu Yi Ku! Liu Sitian!

1098
01:27:08,470 --> 01:27:12,470
Vasily! Vasily!

1099
01:27:12,470 --> 01:27:15,460
Quick, go save Lenin!

1100
01:27:18,480 --> 01:27:23,480
Yang Gao! Yang Gao!

1101
01:27:25,480 --> 01:27:28,480
Careful, it's poison!

1102
01:27:41,500 --> 01:27:44,490
Careful, it's poison!

1103
01:27:52,510 --> 01:27:54,510
Shit, where were you bastards?

1104
01:27:54,550 --> 01:27:56,510
Where the hell did you go?

1105
01:27:56,520 --> 01:27:57,520
Been looking all over for you.

1106
01:27:57,550 --> 01:28:00,510
Never mind, follow me.

1107
01:29:05,590 --> 01:29:10,590
Comrades! Some children have
snuck into the theatre...

1108
01:29:10,590 --> 01:29:13,580
so we've had to turn off the projector.

1109
01:29:14,590 --> 01:29:16,600
Where are the kids?

1110
01:29:16,630 --> 01:29:19,590
Everywhere.

1111
01:29:20,600 --> 01:29:22,600
I didn't see them.

1112
01:29:22,640 --> 01:29:23,570
Stand up,

1113
01:29:23,600 --> 01:29:25,600
stand up all of you.

1114
01:29:30,610 --> 01:29:33,600
How's this happen?

1115
01:29:34,610 --> 01:29:37,610
Who was watching the door?

1116
01:29:37,650 --> 01:29:40,610
Not one came through the door!

1117
01:29:41,620 --> 01:29:44,610
This film is under criticism,

1118
01:29:45,620 --> 01:29:47,590
it is extremely poisonous...

1119
01:29:47,630 --> 01:29:53,630
children could be let astray
by it to commit major crimes.

1120
01:29:53,630 --> 01:29:56,600
That's it for the film.

1121
01:29:56,640 --> 01:30:02,640
Just let their parents take them home.

1122
01:30:21,660 --> 01:30:29,650
The moonlight stirs my heart
on this enchanted evening.

1123
01:30:34,670 --> 01:30:37,670
With my sweetheart by my side.

1124
01:30:42,680 --> 01:30:45,670
Only the wind softly singing...

1125
01:30:49,690 --> 01:30:59,680
The moonlight stirs my heart
on this enchanted evening.

1126
01:31:05,700 --> 01:31:08,700
The long night is quickly
receding under the misty dawn

1127
01:31:12,710 --> 01:31:15,700
I wish you well, girl, with all my heart

1128
01:31:18,720 --> 01:31:26,710
and hope that neither
of us will ever forget

1129
01:31:27,730 --> 01:31:30,720
this evening on the outskirts of Moscow.

1130
01:31:56,760 --> 01:31:58,760
You sleeping?

1131
01:31:58,790 --> 01:32:00,720
No.

1132
01:32:00,760 --> 01:32:01,760
Why haven't you said anything?

1133
01:32:01,800 --> 01:32:04,750
You haven't either.

1134
01:32:06,770 --> 01:32:07,770
Why don't you try to sleep?

1135
01:32:07,800 --> 01:32:09,730
I'd fall off.

1136
01:32:09,770 --> 01:32:10,770
Hold on to my waist.

1137
01:32:10,800 --> 01:32:11,770
You don't mind?

1138
01:32:11,810 --> 01:32:14,760
No.

1139
01:32:16,780 --> 01:32:19,770
That was the most
perfect day of my life.

1140
01:32:20,780 --> 01:32:25,780
The morning breeze raised
goosebumps on my skin...

1141
01:32:25,780 --> 01:32:28,780
and I remember the delicious
smell of burning-off.

1142
01:32:29,790 --> 01:32:32,780
But who'd be burning
dead grass in summer?

1143
01:32:33,790 --> 01:32:34,760
Whatever the truth is...

1144
01:32:34,790 --> 01:32:39,800
everything that happened that summer
had the scent of burning grass.

1145
01:32:43,800 --> 01:32:45,800
Here it is.

1146
01:32:47,810 --> 01:32:50,800
That's our farm.

1147
01:32:52,810 --> 01:32:55,800
Thanks for carrying me all that way!

1148
01:32:56,820 --> 01:32:58,780
I can take you further if you like.

1149
01:32:58,820 --> 01:33:01,820
No need, I can cut through this orchard.

1150
01:33:01,860 --> 01:33:03,820
Go home and get some sleep. Bye!

1151
01:33:03,860 --> 01:33:06,810
Bye!

1152
01:33:29,850 --> 01:33:32,840
I saw Mi Lan again in
my dreams last night.

1153
01:33:35,850 --> 01:33:38,850
Dad!

1154
01:34:15,890 --> 01:34:18,890
Mom's father died.

1155
01:34:38,920 --> 01:34:41,920
They said Grandpa 'committed
suicide to escape punishment'.

1156
01:34:41,920 --> 01:34:45,920
A 'landlord', 'capitalist', KMT
member and 'counterrevolutionary'...

1157
01:34:47,930 --> 01:34:51,930
his home was searched for gold
and documents he didn't have.

1158
01:34:51,930 --> 01:34:54,930
Tortured physically and mentally,

1159
01:34:54,970 --> 01:34:56,900
he died in anger.

1160
01:34:56,940 --> 01:34:58,940
Later I learned my father's superiors

1161
01:34:58,970 --> 01:35:00,940
hadn't approved of my mother

1162
01:35:00,970 --> 01:35:02,910
because of grandpa,

1163
01:35:02,940 --> 01:35:08,940
and it hurt dad's career prospects.

1164
01:35:08,950 --> 01:35:10,450
Ma also lost her teaching job

1165
01:35:10,480 --> 01:35:11,920
and became an army dependent.

1166
01:35:11,950 --> 01:35:14,920
And her temper got worse and worse.

1167
01:35:14,950 --> 01:35:16,960
Before school, I lived
with Grandpa and Grandma,

1168
01:35:16,990 --> 01:35:18,920
I couldn't understand

1169
01:35:18,960 --> 01:35:21,950
how he could have been a class enemy.

1170
01:35:22,960 --> 01:35:23,960
After Grandpa's death,

1171
01:35:24,000 --> 01:35:26,930
Ma became sullen.

1172
01:35:26,970 --> 01:35:29,960
I went back to my wicked old ways.

1173
01:35:32,970 --> 01:35:34,970
The first thing I did after my return

1174
01:35:35,010 --> 01:35:37,980
was to look for Mi Lan.

1175
01:35:38,010 --> 01:35:40,990
Mi Lan! Mi Lan!

1176
01:35:41,030 --> 01:35:43,970
Who's there?

1177
01:35:51,990 --> 01:35:54,980
Who's there?

1178
01:35:57,000 --> 01:35:59,990
Don't run!

1179
01:36:24,020 --> 01:36:27,010
Don't cry!

1180
01:36:36,030 --> 01:36:39,030
Gooloomoo

1181
01:36:41,040 --> 01:36:44,030
Oo-ba!

1182
01:37:35,090 --> 01:37:38,060
Oh, Monkey!

1183
01:37:38,100 --> 01:37:39,060
Where'd you come from?

1184
01:37:39,100 --> 01:37:41,100
Haven't seen you for
days! We missed you.

1185
01:37:41,130 --> 01:37:44,090
I missed you guys too.

1186
01:37:45,100 --> 01:37:47,070
Something happened at my grandparents,

1187
01:37:47,110 --> 01:37:50,110
and I went back to
Tangshan with my folks.

1188
01:37:50,140 --> 01:37:51,630
I wanted to see you.

1189
01:37:51,660 --> 01:37:53,110
I've a great idea.

1190
01:37:53,150 --> 01:37:54,080
What?

1191
01:37:54,110 --> 01:37:56,080
You have a great idea?!

1192
01:37:56,110 --> 01:37:59,120
When'd you get so full of yourself?

1193
01:37:59,150 --> 01:38:00,120
You've just noticed, have you?

1194
01:38:00,150 --> 01:38:01,080
Just.

1195
01:38:01,120 --> 01:38:04,120
But how'd you hide it from me?

1196
01:38:04,160 --> 01:38:06,140
I hid it deep inside.

1197
01:38:06,180 --> 01:38:07,650
What else are you hiding?

1198
01:38:07,690 --> 01:38:09,130
So, you want to know, do you?

1199
01:38:09,160 --> 01:38:11,090
Yes, right now.

1200
01:38:11,130 --> 01:38:13,130
Then, I'll tell you...

1201
01:38:13,170 --> 01:38:14,100
Go on.

1202
01:38:14,130 --> 01:38:17,140
You really want to know?

1203
01:38:22,140 --> 01:38:25,130
Oh, Ma Xiaojun! Come over tonight!

1204
01:41:12,310 --> 01:41:17,310
Do you think I'm awkward and fat?

1205
01:41:18,320 --> 01:41:20,280
You're fat cow. What?

1206
01:41:20,320 --> 01:41:23,310
I said, you're fatter now.

1207
01:41:25,320 --> 01:41:26,820
Can't get ivory from the mouth of a dog!

1208
01:41:26,860 --> 01:41:29,090
Can't get ivory from a person, either.

1209
01:41:29,120 --> 01:41:31,320
Can you produce ivory from your mouth?

1210
01:41:37,340 --> 01:41:40,300
Mi Lan.

1211
01:41:40,340 --> 01:41:41,340
He wants you to watch him dive.

1212
01:41:41,370 --> 01:41:42,340
Yeah? I don't want to watch.

1213
01:41:54,350 --> 01:41:57,360
Actually, I'm just a bit thick-waisted.

1214
01:41:57,390 --> 01:41:59,320
Not just your waist.

1215
01:41:59,360 --> 01:42:02,360
Look at those legs, that tummy,

1216
01:42:02,400 --> 01:42:04,360
and here!

1217
01:42:05,360 --> 01:42:08,360
Export quality!

1218
01:42:09,370 --> 01:42:11,330
I am a bit fat.

1219
01:42:11,370 --> 01:42:14,370
Do you think I should be
wearing a bathing suit?

1220
01:42:14,410 --> 01:42:16,340
Does it expose too much of me?

1221
01:42:16,370 --> 01:42:18,380
Nothing I can't see when
you're not wearing one.

1222
01:42:18,410 --> 01:42:19,340
What?

1223
01:42:19,380 --> 01:42:20,340
What do you mean?

1224
01:42:20,380 --> 01:42:23,380
Never mind, you'd be angry.

1225
01:42:23,420 --> 01:42:26,350
Tell me! I won't be angry.

1226
01:42:26,380 --> 01:42:30,380
It's like you've just had a baby.

1227
01:42:30,420 --> 01:42:34,380
Ma Xiaojun! I'm not speaking to you.

1228
01:42:34,390 --> 01:42:36,390
Mi Lan, come on in!

1229
01:42:36,430 --> 01:42:38,400
No, you come here.

1230
01:42:56,410 --> 01:42:59,410
Ma Xiaojun, you're a beast.

1231
01:43:29,450 --> 01:43:32,440
Fuck off.

1232
01:43:37,460 --> 01:43:40,450
Hey, kid, come here.

1233
01:43:43,460 --> 01:43:46,450
You Liu Yiku?

1234
01:43:49,470 --> 01:43:52,460
Yes.

1235
01:43:56,470 --> 01:43:59,470
Biaoge, don't you know each other?

1236
01:44:00,480 --> 01:44:02,450
Let me introduce you.

1237
01:44:02,480 --> 01:44:04,480
This is the famous Biaoge.

1238
01:44:11,490 --> 01:44:12,490
It's no big deal.

1239
01:44:12,530 --> 01:44:15,460
Just asking.

1240
01:44:15,490 --> 01:44:18,000
If that's the case,

1241
01:44:18,030 --> 01:44:20,460
see you around.

1242
01:44:20,500 --> 01:44:23,490
See you around, pal!

1243
01:44:41,520 --> 01:44:42,490
Mi Lan!

1244
01:44:42,520 --> 01:44:45,510
Who's that Biaoge guy?

1245
01:44:50,530 --> 01:44:53,520
You really want to know?

1246
01:44:56,530 --> 01:44:59,530
Forget it.

1247
01:45:00,540 --> 01:45:05,540
Every time I asked about
him, she told me to drop it.

1248
01:45:05,540 --> 01:45:08,040
Later I heard they were
once very close...

1249
01:45:08,080 --> 01:45:10,540
and that he lost his eye on her account.

1250
01:45:11,550 --> 01:45:12,520
From then on,

1251
01:45:12,550 --> 01:45:15,540
Liu Yiku openly took Mi Lan as his chic.

1252
01:45:30,570 --> 01:45:33,570
August 23 was Romanian
Liberation Day...

1253
01:45:33,610 --> 01:45:36,540
and my and Liu Yiku's birthday.

1254
01:45:36,570 --> 01:45:39,570
We were born the same
day, different year.

1255
01:45:39,610 --> 01:45:42,570
We had a party at the Moscow Restaurant.

1256
01:45:49,590 --> 01:45:52,580
Hello!

1257
01:45:54,590 --> 01:45:56,560
Hi! You're looking gorgeous!

1258
01:45:56,590 --> 01:45:58,600
I feel about you like the
Masses about the Party.

1259
01:45:58,630 --> 01:46:00,560
Like the Masses about the Party!

1260
01:46:00,600 --> 01:46:03,590
Look what I've brought
the birthday boys.

1261
01:46:05,600 --> 01:46:06,600
Hands clean?

1262
01:46:06,640 --> 01:46:07,610
Check them out.

1263
01:46:07,640 --> 01:46:10,600
OK.

1264
01:46:13,610 --> 01:46:16,600
Wow! Pushkin's poetry!

1265
01:46:21,620 --> 01:46:23,620
Won't you look sharp skating in that!

1266
01:46:23,660 --> 01:46:25,590
Really sharp.

1267
01:46:25,620 --> 01:46:27,120
No chick will be able
to resist his advances.

1268
01:46:27,160 --> 01:46:28,630
Wrong
- they'll surround him. No need to advance.

1269
01:46:28,660 --> 01:46:30,640
No good, no good, that's too dangerous.

1270
01:46:30,680 --> 01:46:32,620
If they surround him
the ice will crack...

1271
01:46:33,630 --> 01:46:34,630
...give that to me, it's safer.

1272
01:46:34,670 --> 01:46:36,600
Thank you.

1273
01:46:36,630 --> 01:46:39,640
Look at you. You're just
going to say 'thank you'?

1274
01:46:39,670 --> 01:46:41,160
What should I do?

1275
01:46:41,190 --> 01:46:42,610
Think about it.

1276
01:46:42,640 --> 01:46:45,630
Open yours, Ma Xiaojun.

1277
01:46:50,650 --> 01:46:52,650
She looks after you
like the Party itself.

1278
01:46:52,690 --> 01:46:54,650
For once you've said something clever.

1279
01:46:54,690 --> 01:46:56,620
Try it on.

1280
01:46:56,650 --> 01:46:58,160
The waist looks right.

1281
01:46:58,190 --> 01:47:00,430
Then it'll fit, won't it?

1282
01:47:00,460 --> 01:47:02,660
Not necessarily. Try it on.

1283
01:47:02,700 --> 01:47:03,660
Try it on! Try it on!

1284
01:47:03,700 --> 01:47:06,630
Gutter-heads!

1285
01:47:06,660 --> 01:47:08,670
Ignore them. Just
practice your swimming.

1286
01:47:08,700 --> 01:47:09,670
I'm still counting on you to save me.

1287
01:47:09,700 --> 01:47:11,630
Well, then no need to thank you.

1288
01:47:11,670 --> 01:47:13,640
It's only so I can save you, after all.

1289
01:47:13,670 --> 01:47:17,670
Consider Liu Yiku's deeply
felt thanks from both of us.

1290
01:47:17,680 --> 01:47:18,680
You're a jerk.

1291
01:47:18,710 --> 01:47:19,680
That's right.

1292
01:47:20,680 --> 01:47:23,680
Comrade, could you bring us our food?

1293
01:47:23,720 --> 01:47:25,700
Or at least some water first?

1294
01:47:25,740 --> 01:47:27,650
Bitch! She's ignoring us.

1295
01:47:27,690 --> 01:47:29,690
Never mind. Let's have some fun.

1296
01:47:29,720 --> 01:47:30,650
How? What’s

1297
01:47:30,690 --> 01:47:31,690
Think! You're always got lots of ideas!

1298
01:47:31,720 --> 01:47:33,660
Let's play 'find the hanky'.

1299
01:47:33,690 --> 01:47:36,690
We can use Ma Xiaojun's red undies.

1300
01:47:36,730 --> 01:47:39,690
Then that's 'find the undies'.

1301
01:47:40,700 --> 01:47:44,700
I've got a game.

1302
01:47:44,700 --> 01:47:46,700
You're not allowed to ruin your gift!

1303
01:47:46,740 --> 01:47:48,710
Relax, we don't need it.

1304
01:47:48,740 --> 01:47:51,220
Who's got a coin?

1305
01:47:51,260 --> 01:47:53,700
How do you play?

1306
01:47:54,710 --> 01:47:55,680
One enough? Gambling?

1307
01:47:55,710 --> 01:47:58,720
No, it's a test of your
honesty and courage,

1308
01:47:58,750 --> 01:48:01,710
and whether you are a virgin!

1309
01:48:06,720 --> 01:48:08,690
OK! Let's do it!

1310
01:48:08,730 --> 01:48:10,230
I'm putting the coin here.

1311
01:48:10,260 --> 01:48:11,690
Each time I ask a question...

1312
01:48:11,730 --> 01:48:17,730
you have to answer truthfully
while pulling out the coin.

1313
01:48:17,740 --> 01:48:20,740
No dirty tricks, all right?

1314
01:48:21,740 --> 01:48:23,240
First question:

1315
01:48:23,280 --> 01:48:24,710
how old are you?

1316
01:48:24,740 --> 01:48:26,740
No good, can't tell you.

1317
01:48:26,780 --> 01:48:28,710
Older than you.

1318
01:48:28,750 --> 01:48:29,750
I'll let you pass on that one.

1319
01:48:29,780 --> 01:48:32,270
But when's your birthday?

1320
01:48:32,300 --> 01:48:34,530
Pull out the coin first.

1321
01:48:34,560 --> 01:48:36,160
Right. Big Ant knows.

1322
01:48:36,190 --> 01:48:37,720
Right. What's the date?

1323
01:48:37,760 --> 01:48:39,720
January 1, same as the year itself.

1324
01:48:39,760 --> 01:48:42,760
That's more cool than
Romanian Liberation Day.

1325
01:48:42,800 --> 01:48:45,730
Second question. Give me back the coin.

1326
01:48:45,760 --> 01:48:48,760
How old were you when you
had your first boyfriend?

1327
01:48:51,770 --> 01:48:54,270
Uh... 16.

1328
01:48:54,310 --> 01:48:56,540
That's young!

1329
01:48:56,580 --> 01:48:58,740
Third question.

1330
01:48:58,780 --> 01:49:01,770
What did your boyfriend say
to you on the first date?

1331
01:49:04,780 --> 01:49:07,790
Said what?

1332
01:49:07,820 --> 01:49:08,750
What?

1333
01:49:08,790 --> 01:49:11,780
That's so tight! I can't pull it out!

1334
01:49:19,800 --> 01:49:21,800
Monkey, you are a beast.

1335
01:49:21,830 --> 01:49:23,800
You are so bad!

1336
01:49:24,800 --> 01:49:26,800
What are you hitting my head for?

1337
01:49:26,840 --> 01:49:28,770
I'm not your son.

1338
01:49:28,810 --> 01:49:31,800
I was dumb to begin with, but
it gets worse with every hit.

1339
01:49:33,810 --> 01:49:36,800
What's wrong, Ma Xiaojun?

1340
01:49:41,820 --> 01:49:42,790
Mao Xiaojun?

1341
01:49:42,820 --> 01:49:45,810
What's going on? Don't touch me!

1342
01:49:49,830 --> 01:49:51,830
Ma Xiaojun.

1343
01:49:51,860 --> 01:49:53,830
You're angry.

1344
01:49:53,870 --> 01:49:55,800
No...

1345
01:49:55,830 --> 01:49:57,330
why should I be angry?

1346
01:49:57,370 --> 01:49:59,100
So why are you so upset?

1347
01:49:59,140 --> 01:50:01,490
Who's upset? Not me!

1348
01:50:01,520 --> 01:50:03,810
What did I ever do...

1349
01:50:03,840 --> 01:50:04,840
to make you behave like this to me?

1350
01:50:04,880 --> 01:50:07,830
Nothing, you've been great.

1351
01:50:08,850 --> 01:50:10,810
Ma Xiaojun,

1352
01:50:10,850 --> 01:50:12,850
everyone was having a good time,

1353
01:50:12,890 --> 01:50:14,870
you can dish it out...

1354
01:50:14,900 --> 01:50:16,380
but you can't take it in.

1355
01:50:16,410 --> 01:50:18,140
I use my wit, not my hands.

1356
01:50:18,170 --> 01:50:19,510
Why don't you use yours?

1357
01:50:19,550 --> 01:50:20,860
You're not being very nice.

1358
01:50:20,890 --> 01:50:22,830
I'm not a nice person.

1359
01:50:22,860 --> 01:50:24,860
I mean, you're not like you were before.

1360
01:50:24,900 --> 01:50:26,830
I am too.

1361
01:50:26,860 --> 01:50:27,830
No, you're not.

1362
01:50:27,870 --> 01:50:30,860
Well, you're not either.

1363
01:50:35,870 --> 01:50:37,880
Are you sick of me?

1364
01:50:37,910 --> 01:50:39,890
So what if I were?

1365
01:50:39,930 --> 01:50:41,840
What if I were not?

1366
01:50:41,880 --> 01:50:44,880
If you're not, I'll
stay for your birthday.

1367
01:50:44,920 --> 01:50:45,900
If you are, I'll go.

1368
01:50:45,940 --> 01:50:46,850
Comrade Waitress!

1369
01:50:46,880 --> 01:50:48,850
Can't you bring us our food?

1370
01:50:48,890 --> 01:50:50,890
We're so hungry we are getting cranky.

1371
01:50:50,920 --> 01:50:53,880
Then go.

1372
01:50:55,890 --> 01:50:57,900
Can I ask why?

1373
01:50:57,930 --> 01:50:59,860
No reason.

1374
01:50:59,900 --> 01:51:01,900
Calm down, Ma Xiaojun.

1375
01:51:01,930 --> 01:51:02,870
Drop it.

1376
01:51:02,900 --> 01:51:04,870
No. Let her go!

1377
01:51:04,900 --> 01:51:05,900
Monkey, drop it.
Hunger's put us on edge.

1378
01:51:10,910 --> 01:51:12,880
You still haven't left?

1379
01:51:12,910 --> 01:51:15,900
Didn't you say you'd go? Fuck off!

1380
01:51:16,910 --> 01:51:19,920
I'd better go then.

1381
01:51:19,950 --> 01:51:21,880
Sit down.

1382
01:51:21,920 --> 01:51:24,920
Ma Xiaojun? Give me a litter
face and let her stay, all right?

1383
01:51:24,960 --> 01:51:26,890
No way.

1384
01:51:26,920 --> 01:51:28,930
I'll take on anyone who's on her side.

1385
01:51:31,930 --> 01:51:33,930
Fuck you, it's you I'm pissed off at!

1386
01:51:33,970 --> 01:51:36,920
I'll kill you!

1387
01:51:42,940 --> 01:51:45,930
I'll get you! You're dead!

1388
01:52:01,960 --> 01:52:03,930
Ha ha! don't believe any of it.

1389
01:52:03,960 --> 01:52:05,960
I never did anything
so "heroic" in my life.

1390
01:52:07,970 --> 01:52:09,970
I keep reminding my
self to tell the truth.

1391
01:52:10,000 --> 01:52:12,990
But no matter how I try,

1392
01:52:13,020 --> 01:52:15,000
something keeps interfering.

1393
01:52:15,030 --> 01:52:16,970
and the facts slip away.

1394
01:52:20,980 --> 01:52:22,980
My memory plays with and betrays me.

1395
01:52:25,980 --> 01:52:27,990
I don't know what the truth is myself.

1396
01:52:29,990 --> 01:52:32,980
I even suspect I didn't meet
Mi Lan for the first time...

1397
01:52:33,990 --> 01:52:35,960
on the street but when she visited.

1398
01:52:35,990 --> 01:52:39,000
That afternoon, Liu Yiku asked
her over, and Big Ant and I...

1399
01:52:39,030 --> 01:52:41,020
waited at the gate for her...

1400
01:52:41,050 --> 01:52:42,970
that's the first time we met...

1401
01:52:43,000 --> 01:52:46,000
and that's why Big Ant
and I played Vasily.

1402
01:52:46,040 --> 01:52:48,010
and didn't talk a lot to her.

1403
01:52:48,040 --> 01:52:50,970
I hardly knew her.

1404
01:52:51,010 --> 01:52:54,000
In fact, I never really knew her.

1405
01:52:55,010 --> 01:52:56,980
Heavens!

1406
01:52:57,010 --> 01:53:00,010
Is Mi Lan the girl in the photograph?

1407
01:53:00,050 --> 01:53:03,010
And whatever happened to Yu Beipei?

1408
01:53:04,020 --> 01:53:05,990
Maybe...

1409
01:53:06,020 --> 01:53:09,020
she and Mi Lan were the same person?

1410
01:53:10,030 --> 01:53:13,000
I really don't dare think about it.

1411
01:53:13,030 --> 01:53:15,030
I started telling this
story in all sincerity and...

1412
01:53:15,070 --> 01:53:18,020
then forced it to turn into a lie.

1413
01:53:19,040 --> 01:53:21,040
Is that a reason to give it up?

1414
01:53:21,070 --> 01:53:22,000
No, no.

1415
01:53:22,040 --> 01:53:25,030
and you wouldn't want me to, either...

1416
01:53:28,050 --> 01:53:30,050
How hard it is to keep your promises!

1417
01:53:30,080 --> 01:53:32,050
True honesty is impossible.

1418
01:53:35,050 --> 01:53:38,020
Listen,

1419
01:53:38,060 --> 01:53:41,050
sometimes a sound or a smell...

1420
01:53:41,090 --> 01:53:44,050
takes you right back to the past.

1421
01:54:00,080 --> 01:54:03,070
My head is as clear as the moon.

1422
01:54:05,080 --> 01:54:07,050
So I'll continue our story.

1423
01:54:07,080 --> 01:54:10,080
Never mind whether it's the truth.

1424
01:54:11,090 --> 01:54:12,090
Nothing bad happened...

1425
01:54:12,120 --> 01:54:15,060
on my birthday.

1426
01:54:15,090 --> 01:54:17,090
Liu Yiku and I had a great time...

1427
01:54:17,130 --> 01:54:20,100
taking turns toasting Mi Lan.

1428
01:54:20,130 --> 01:54:22,100
Yu Beipei was there too.

1429
01:54:22,130 --> 01:54:24,070
I almost forgot.

1430
01:54:24,100 --> 01:54:26,600
There were stacks of gifts.

1431
01:54:26,640 --> 01:54:29,070
Mi Lan was really affectionate,

1432
01:54:29,110 --> 01:54:32,100
fixing me with that gimlet gaze of hers.

1433
01:54:36,110 --> 01:54:39,110
We all got very drunk.

1434
01:55:01,140 --> 01:55:03,640
Mi Lan!

1435
01:55:03,670 --> 01:55:06,130
Mi Lan!

1436
01:55:07,140 --> 01:55:10,140
Mi Lan!

1437
01:55:10,180 --> 01:55:13,140
Mi Lan!

1438
01:55:15,150 --> 01:55:18,140
Mi Lan!

1439
01:55:21,160 --> 01:55:24,150
Mi Lan!

1440
01:55:25,160 --> 01:55:28,150
Mi Lan!

1441
01:55:34,170 --> 01:55:36,170
Mi Lan!

1442
01:55:36,210 --> 01:55:38,190
Ma Xiaojun?

1443
01:55:38,230 --> 01:55:40,700
What is it?

1444
01:55:40,730 --> 01:55:43,170
What's wrong?

1445
01:55:44,180 --> 01:55:47,180
Tell me, what's wrong?

1446
01:55:47,220 --> 01:55:50,190
I really like you.

1447
01:55:50,220 --> 01:55:53,160
What?

1448
01:55:53,190 --> 01:55:55,160
What are you saying?

1449
01:55:55,190 --> 01:55:58,180
I... my bike... my
bike fell in the ditch.

1450
01:56:25,220 --> 01:56:26,190
Afterwards...

1451
01:56:26,220 --> 01:56:29,230
it seemed that nothing had happened.

1452
01:56:29,260 --> 01:56:31,250
I tried to remind her of that,

1453
01:56:31,280 --> 01:56:33,750
but she didn't react at all.

1454
01:56:33,790 --> 01:56:36,220
She still treated me nicely.

1455
01:56:37,230 --> 01:56:40,230
Is it possible that what
happened that night wasn't real?

1456
01:56:42,240 --> 01:56:45,230
But the part where I
was injured still hurts!

1457
01:58:06,320 --> 01:58:09,320
Ma Xiaojun.

1458
01:58:12,330 --> 01:58:13,330
What are you doing?

1459
01:58:13,370 --> 01:58:15,340
Let me go!

1460
01:58:15,380 --> 01:58:17,320
Let me go!

1461
01:59:32,410 --> 01:59:34,410
This is how you get your kicks?

1462
01:59:34,450 --> 01:59:37,400
You bet!

1463
02:00:13,450 --> 02:00:16,450
Mi Lan and I were no longer friends.

1464
02:00:16,490 --> 02:00:17,420
Soon.

1465
02:00:17,450 --> 02:00:20,460
the others began to stay
away from me as well.

1466
02:00:20,490 --> 02:00:23,450
I passed my days in bitterness and pain.

1467
02:03:38,660 --> 02:03:41,650
Two months later. Mi Lan
stopped hanging out with us.

1468
02:03:42,660 --> 02:03:45,660
At the end of the year, Liu
Yiku went back to the army...

1469
02:03:45,700 --> 02:03:48,680
and found a proper girlfriend.

1470
02:03:48,720 --> 02:03:51,690
Later, we all went into the army.

1471
02:03:51,730 --> 02:03:54,700
I heard that Liu Yiku went mad...

1472
02:03:54,740 --> 02:03:57,700
in the border war with Vietnam.

1473
02:03:57,740 --> 02:04:00,670
We all lost touch after awhile.

1474
02:05:06,740 --> 02:05:07,740
What now? What's going on?

1475
02:05:07,780 --> 02:05:09,260
Who's that?

1476
02:05:09,300 --> 02:05:10,710
Oo! Oo-ba!

1477
02:05:10,750 --> 02:05:12,750
What do you mean "Oo-ba"?
It's "Gooloomoo"!

1478
02:05:12,780 --> 02:05:15,740
Gooloomoo!

1479
02:05:16,750 --> 02:05:18,760
Hey! Gooloomoo!

1480
02:05:18,790 --> 02:05:21,280
Gooloomoo!

1481
02:05:21,310 --> 02:05:23,540
Gooloomoo!

1482
02:05:23,570 --> 02:05:26,160
Gooloomoo!

1483
02:05:26,200 --> 02:05:28,750
Cretin.
