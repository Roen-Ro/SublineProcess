1
00:00:13,613 --> 00:00:15,615
Peiking has changed so fast.

2
00:00:20,620 --> 00:00:23,612
In 20 years, it's become a modern city.

3
00:00:24,624 --> 00:00:27,616
Almost nothing is as I remembered.

4
00:00:28,628 --> 00:00:31,596
Change has wiped out my memorize.

5
00:00:31,631 --> 00:00:34,623
I can't tell what's
imagined from what's real.

6
00:00:36,636 --> 00:00:39,604
My stories always take place in summer.

7
00:00:39,639 --> 00:00:42,636
People expose more of
themselves in the heat.

8
00:00:42,671 --> 00:00:45,634
and find it harder to
control their desires.

9
00:00:46,646 --> 00:00:49,614
It seemed like it was
always summer then.

10
00:00:49,649 --> 00:00:52,652
The sun always had time to
come out and play with us.

11
00:00:52,687 --> 00:00:54,654
The sunlight was so relentless,

12
00:00:54,689 --> 00:00:56,621
so bright,

13
00:00:56,656 --> 00:00:59,659
that our eyes were washed
in waves of blackness.

14
00:00:59,694 --> 00:01:02,651
In the Heat of the Sun.
